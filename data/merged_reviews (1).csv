R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,19,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R935PCZ92UVGL,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Happy,B. Hinson,5,"We bought this for a trip to the beach and it did not disappoint. Quick easy connection to our phones, good sound quality, solid build and long battery life. We have since found ourselves grabbing it instead of our existing outdoor speakers for using on the back patio. One feature we did not think we would use but really like is the speaker phone function. It is really nice for conversations with family that multiple people want to be involved in. Better then iPhone speaker phone alone.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024",AFPN35SDBWBDQAGNSNQJQPQH5C2Q,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R4BQHA0TLLJNN,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!,Leox,5,"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,True,9,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R39X7USU3OX34C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good,Justin,5,"So I’m super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AFSZPNTTLYCLNP536L6VS6UMFTNQ,True,7,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,6,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,True,7,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RTDXQGCW5S0SA,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

USB-C charging. Long battery. I’ve only had it for a couple months but it’s the best bluetooth speaker i’ve owned.

R10YJBZGOB4SBS,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars No App for IOS. No way to disable loud startup/poweroff tones,Kindle in Hawaii,4,"Love these speakers, but Apple seemed to have made a bit screw up.The speaker makes a very loud startup and power down sound. NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple. Hope they will get around someday to updating or creating a new app or just add this functionality inside the existing IOS to support disabling of these tones.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2024",AEF7JE6TACESBPXTYHKCLUEIJVFA,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

When I turn it on, it starts playing music from somewhere else and I have no idea what it is doing. Not a techno luddite. Have experience as programmer. If it is a mystery to me, probably a mystery to everyone else too.

R2OYAX691GNN4K,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Compact Portable Speakers,Student Nurse,5,"I picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were “How is this going to sound?”, “Will this live up to its price?” & “How good is the build quality?”. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don’t want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the “Statement Red” as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won’t be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

It has a detachable lanyard that makes it easy to carry, and a silicone backing for an easy grip. Despite the small size, it delivers powerful sound with good bass and clear highs. I mostly use this out by the pool, so I like the IP67 water rating. It’s been heavily splashed several times, with no ill effects. The battery life is excellent, and easily lasts me through a couple of days of listening. It comes with a USB-C TO USB-C charging cable.I love that this doubles as a speakerphone. I can connect it to my laptop for work calls, and the sound quality is excellent. Beats is a quintessentially Apple product, but don’t let that scare you off if you’re an Android fan like myself.

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3KPQBYL6X3PQX,B0D4SX9RC6,3.0 out of 5 stars Sounds good. Not overly loud. Needs more buttons,Carpe_Diem,3,"This Bluetooth speaker is on the higher end of the price range for a small form factor speaker.Priced similarly to the JBL Extreme 2 (which I also have) the sound quality is about the same. Which is to say, very good for a small speaker.Compared to the JBL, the Beats Pill is:Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality.Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap (which you can also use to hang the speaker)Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing.My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons. There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface. If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

RHKDESTZ0ZGPK,B08VKXP1VY,5.0 out of 5 stars Hard to fault for only $200 and perfect for studio and location photographers,oakie,5,"I just picked this up to replace a Klipsch BT speaker I’ve used for over 10 years.Why do I own a BT speaker and how do I use it? I’m a photographer and knowing the model’s music preferences, and having a service like Apple Music or Spotify, allows me to play music during the shoot to help put them at ease and bring out a bit of rhythm to help with posing, especially flow posing. Carefully adjusting the playlist can help bring about desired body language and facial expressions.The sound isn’t great but it’s very, very good, with a prominent midrange and inoffensive treble with sufficient baritone and bass notes. It’s been tuned well for its size and should work well with most any genre of music. Despite being designed and advertised as “360 degree sound,” the tweeter is clearly front-biased while either a port or passive radiator is rear-biased.Listening to Duffy “Rockferry” and Caro Emerald “Deleted Scenes From the Cutting Room Floor” both sound great. I’m not ashamed to break this out for a studio portrait or conceptual art shoot.The buttons could be better labeled with the industry standard rather than proprietary choices, but once you figure it out, it’s fine. I don’t need the water resistance but it’s nice knowing it’s durable. The exterior of my Triple Black unit is delightfully understated. Battery life is serviceable… I’d expect a unit of this size to have at least double the advertised runtime, so a charging base is already in the shopping cart. The lack of USB-C quick charging, especially in this latest, version II release is a huge letdown.The inclusion of a 1/4”-20 thread in the base, the standard thread for photography, is a huge boon, especially for photographers and using while outdoors as it can easily be mounted on a tripod or light stand for better sound performance.Ultimately, it all comes back to sound. It’s far better balanced than the Beats Pill and is able to be played at full volume, unlike the Beats, of which the bass heavy tuning causes the full range drivers to rattle and flutter at full blast. While the Revolve II is clearly directionally biased, it’s not as bad as unidirectional speakers like the Beats Pill. I’m able to set this up on a tripod in the studio, connect Apple Music, set volume to half and never have to touch it again as the sound is delivered in all directions.For the price, it’s one of the better portable BT speakers available. If you need more volume and higher fidelity, I’d recommend the Plus version, as it is large enough to accept Bose’s signature tuning and does sound better overall. However, for my purposes, the non-Plus version fits perfectly in my camera bag, alongside my lenses, making it perfect for studio and on-location use.It’s the best collection of compromises for the price point and sounds almost as good as it looks. The sound is actually so mid-focused and clean, I’m considering buying a second one to use in stereo with my iMac, just plucking one off it’s charging base whenever I head out to the studio or location.If you want a $200 portable BT speaker, you’d be crazy to buy anything besides this, unless you’re an uncompromising bass head. If that’s the case, buy a Sony and avoid the Beats Pill.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2021",AFV2VEDSKXKRS6JB2CGOAMKAJCQQ,True,107,Color: Black
R35NP18QWTDE4K,B08VKXP1VY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Hey, it's Bose!",Kurt LaRue,5,"I purchased this Bose Soundlink Revolve series II to replace an older UE Megaboom that was no longer holding a battery charge.First of alI, I was impressed by how easy it was to pair the bluetooth with our Android phones and our Samsung tablet.The controls are easily accessible on the top, and fairly intuitive. I also purchased the companion charging base, which certainly is not a necessity, but is convenient, and not outrageously priced.I was a little surprised at the diminutive size; this unit is much smaller than the Megaboom, with far less pronounced bass, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The Megaboom was just that - ""boomy"". The Bose is much tighter in the low end and due to its size and weight, is easily portable.To my ears, the sound is pretty much omnidirectional as advertised. I walked in circles around it with music playing and did not notice any real hotspots or dead zones. Fairly even spread.Now let me state what this is NOT: Loud. If you are looking for a party speaker that will make your local DJ envious, this is not the product you are looking for.My wife and I are musicians, and we own professional sound equipment that will shake the walls and rattle the windows. I did not buy this Bose unit to do that. I wanted something that would allow us to have background music playing at a small gathering, while not overpowering normal conversation, or for when my wife and I are sitting on the patio by the firepit listening to oldies. For this use, it is perfect! Enough volume to clearly hear the tunes, but not so loud as to bother the neighbors.Battery life is advertised as ""up to"" 13 hours (and the Browns may win the Super Bowl). That's far longer than we will likely ever need, and I haven't tested its limits yet. In fact, we leave it on the charging base most of the time. Personally, I'll be happy if it gives us four hours of battery play time.In summary, it's Bose...legendary quality and distinctive ""Bose"" sound. If you're not a confirmed, Bose-hating audiophile, or expecting a PA system, this little thing could be exactly what you're looking for!My verdict: Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AGX3CDO57UMIC6AN7SE7B4J56NRA,True,97,Color: Black

It really cranked out some loud clear music with great base for a little speaker. It’s got some weight to it as well. Mine put out awesome sound at first but after using it a handful of times I realize the loudest I could raise volume was no longer Truly loud & impressive anymore! Went from “can’t talk over this” loud, to “why can I hear what you’re saying when I have this turned all the way up?” There were literally no helpful instructions so I pressed a button, pressed another, turned it off and back on… loud booming sound was restored. After shutting it off overnight and turning on again next day, it was back to not raising volume properly. My sister did not have this issue with hers so I deemed mine defective and not worth the struggle to try to make it work as expected each time I turned it on. Thankfully I noticed this just in time that I could still return it, which I did. I’m on the fence about buying it again. When it worked right it was great!

R3GNXXYV87SIX7,B08VKXP1VY,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Product but Terrible Instructions,Art Lover,4,"I purchased this rather expensive speaker because it supposedly had a standard audio connection. (Most of the other small speakers I found had bluetooth only.) I have an ipod and a CD player that do not have bluetooth but do have outputs for headphones or speakers, using standard audio cables. It took me over a month to figure out how to get it to work with the standard audio (non-bluetooth) connection because THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE SO TERRIBLE, UNINFORMATIVE, AND VAGUE! It was mostly pictures, with a little bit of text explaining things, and rather unclear information about which button on the top of the unit was for what purpose. I bought a white one and, in the manner promulgated by Apple and copied by so many others, the buttons on the product are printed in light grey, which is barely visible against the white background, making the buttons barely visible. But, even worse, there was nothing in the instructions that clearly explained what each button was for.I spent hours trying to understand the very minimal instructions. On page 5 it showed someone using what appeared to be a remote control to use the product, but there was no remote control in the box. Finally, on page 6, I discovered that what they wanted me to do was download an app onto my smart phone in order to control the device. I suppose those without smart phones are out of luck? There was certainly nothing on the outside of the box or the on-line description, saying ""smart phone required"". I did download the app and found it to be more trouble than it was worth, and about as uninformative as the instruction booklet in terms of explaining how to use the device if you are a non-bluetooth customer.When I connected my ipod or CD player to the speaker, I could get no sound to come out. Finally, after trying all sorts of things, I spotted this little button with a tiny + sign on the top of the unit. No, not the ""increase volume"" button, but another, smaller button on the other side of the top of the unit. When I pushed it, sound suddenly came out from my ipod and/or CD player! Apparently this little + button acts like the ""start/stop"" button on my Bose headphones. Except that the instructions did not eplain the purpose of this button.Now that I have gotten it to work, the speaker seems to work well. Like so many Bose products, the bass is a little too heavy, apparently in an effort to convince people that it is a higher quality device so as to justify the high price. But i can finally hear my music and audiobooks via a good sounding loudspeaker. Now I just have to figure out how to turn off the irritating voice that speaks every time I turn it on and tells me it is connected to ""USB"". No, it isn't connected to a USB device. It is connected to a standard audio device.Apparently, electronic device manufacturers, in an attempt to save money on reference manuals in different languages, have all decided to use instructions that attempt to show you how to use their products using pictures. Well, as a real customer I want to put in my 2 cents here and tell them all that I do not appreciate poor quality instructions and reference manuals. I especially dislike the ones that, like this one, are printed so small that even a lawyer would balk at the tiny print. I had to magnify this one 3x on my scanner in order to get things large enough for me to read. I am an 80 year old, not a 20 year old, and my eyesight isn't what it was when I was a lot younger. Then again, back then the manufacturers of products like this hired competent human factors engineers and technical writers to make sure their instructional material was of high quality and their products were easy to use by real customers. I should know, as in one of my first jobs back then I was not allowed to declare the job complete until the human factors engineers had approved everything. They would not have approved the hard-to-see buttons on the top of the unit or the instructions that came with this unit.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AEN7NE42VMRT55T2H6EXHI5AHWCA,True,10,Color: Silver

RGRIEP9WAX3F1,B08VKXP1VY,4.0 out of 5 stars Not for everyone,NakedtotheBlues,4,"The fullness, range of sound and intricacies of sound brought tears to my eyes. I test speakers in the range I am capable of hearing. I have almost lost the ability to hear and understand human speech. Upon configuring these, they synked to bluetooth effortlessly. I found the drivers need high volume for the base to get snappy. These speakers cover the frequency rang of high accents in soft strings, midrange horns, vocals and the mid-base of lower frequency response. This speaker is for those of us who want to hear the subtlties of how the music is mixed and the full compliment of soundstage depth. If you are more concerned with base response there is plenty to pick from. If you do this, you will lose all the engineering and testing done to achieve the compliment of sound that is bose 360 degree signal response. These are so acuurate at reproducing instruments that your favorite songs of yesteryear are heard to have more richness and texture of sound than conventional band pass subwoofer enthusists. I am so enthralled, I just ordered two more of the big brother to this model.A month in to testing and i discovered what many of you already know. If we select a location that has two walls making a corner of the room, this is a different speaker. I found a sweet spot sitting in the middle of each speaker placed eight inches from a wood fence in my yard. The speakers placed ten feet apart. This caused a shift in the dynamic range of the speaker set. Suddenly, with the percussion of the base climbed to the forefront of my audio experience. When the speakers were fifteen feet in each direction, I had to turn the volume up to achieve the same base response. I personally am not fond of going into settings on the I-phone, finding music and then adjusting the mix from there. These speakers have simple add on gadgets. No EQ, Not a smart speaker, jus a damn fine small speaker that can impress when a person is patient enough to learn about set and setting.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AFDKYPT3PFSBI6EDBWA7MCQD5EIQ,True,51,Color: Black

One of the reasons I bought it was because I assumed Bose would have good quality and they said the battery life was 14, or maybe it was 10hrs, but it lasts nothing close to that. If you're outside, you pretty much have to turn it up to full volume...and then it might last you 6-7 hrs. And the instructions are just crap. The micro printing is so small you better take a picture and blow it up. And then it doesnt tell you ANYTHING!!! The button with a line through a circle should be the on/off, but I don't know what the hell it does. The button with the three dots seems to be the one that will turn it on. I'm semi happy with it, but it seems the way business is done now is stretch the truth a LOT and give you the bare minimum...if that.

This SoundLink speaker sounds awesome and the Bluetooth works great on different devices in a variety of environments. Pictured, it's on the bed of a hotel room to not disturb other guests yet filling the room with great sound. While easy to hold in the hand, it's a bit clumsy for transporting unless you spend about $20 for a third party carrying case that Bose should have included. The case also has pouches for the charging cord and other audio cords. I am a biased Bose fan, but this speaker does not disappoint.

The sound is decent, crisp, battery life seems good, but there's a major issue with this product.At this price point, it should absolutely blow away lower cost competition. I have a Sony SRSXB2 that I purchased 5+ years ago, and it is every bit as good as far as sound, as this Bose is. It isn't that the Bose sounds bad, the sound is good, but as I stated, at that price point the sound should be WAY louder and just blow away that cheaper Sony speaker, it flat out doesn't. For that reason I can't rate this higher than 3 stars, the price is too high for that.The only area it exceeds the Sony SRSXB2 is with the quick bluetooth compatibility, and that it tells you how much battery is left every time you connect. Aside from that, nothing else makes it NEAR worth the money, even if it were 110 dollars at half price, there are better alternatives.I even took apart the box and studied the speaker online just to make sure I didn't somehow order a cheap knockoff. Nope, it's the real thing. I'm honestly disappointed to have spent this kind of money and I'm giving serious consideration to returning the speaker and just purchasing a comparable quality for half the price or less.Don't fall for the hype, test out a cheaper brand locally, again, this thing is Bose in name only, not performance.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022",AFD4H6ILOFL24CIRU7TV4MDFAN2Q,True,11,Color: Black

I don't want to risk it! Battery life - if you plan on charging this up and using it extensively, expect the battery to not last long.

R2F10HEPSYF02G,B08VKXP1VY,3.0 out of 5 stars Fair But Not What I Expect From Bose,dogster2025,3,"I bought these hoping to replace an ancient JBL wired computer speaker set. In general, I love Bose speakers—I have one set of 301s over 40 years old that are still kicking after a refoam, as well as near and far-range studio monitors and a home theater setup. So I am comparing Revolve to the ancient computer speakers here.I found the 360 sound in the Revolve Series II lacking, to the point of a marketing gimmick. With just one speaker, I felt off-balance, so I bought a second speaker. Stereo mode sounds okay, deep base, kind of muddy with little separation. Unfortunately, there is no way to EQ them in the Bose App, which would be a marked improvement. If you are playing music from an iPhone you can select different EQ settings—of which I found ""Flat"" to be the best option for most tracks.They're okay for computer speakers and are adequate for near-range listening of fewer than ten feet, but not full enough to use one speaker per area in party mode. In addition, they sound harsh to my ears at higher volumes. However, the small footprint and portability are an advantage. The design is excellent, and the profile is discreet.Would I repurchase them? Due to the range of decent speakers at a lower price point in this category, probably not. However, combined with the JBL speakers, the Bose Revolve II speakers create a more immersive sound for my home office setup without taking up much desk space.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2022",AHHTZRTQEORFV32XFPNNTZMLWX2A,True,0,Color: Silver

R3UC2NZ165R2UV,B08VKXP1VY,3.0 out of 5 stars Bose is no longer the best in audio...,Richard Truchan,3,"Years ago, Bose was the best there was in audio equipment. And while they still make quality products, it seems that they have stalled in one very important area. This is my second Bose purchase in two years. The first was a sound bar for my television and now this Bluetooth speaker. Both suffer from what I consider to be subpar sound quality and even more subpar is the volume capacity. With the sound bar, I ended up buying a Sony that was far better than the Bose. With the Bluetooth speaker, I already had one from Monster, which retailed at around $70. This Bose is more than twice that price and is nowhere near as good as the Monster. So, in conclusion, I will not be buying Bose products anymore. It's pretty clear to me that Monster is the modern standard for audio excellence and much more affordable than Bose. I can walk into my local Sam's Club and purchase a Monster Bluetooth speaker the size of a guitar amp that shakes the foundation and has a whole mess of extra bells and whistles, for less than the price of this subpar Bose speaker. I think that we are only paying for the name at this point. So not worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2023",AHD2CGBFHZHEZO52QPG33LV6XDFA,True,6,Color: Black

R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,19,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my.

Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,6,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,True,7,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RTDXQGCW5S0SA,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2OYAX691GNN4K,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Compact Portable Speakers,Student Nurse,5,"I picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were “How is this going to sound?”, “Will this live up to its price?” & “How good is the build quality?”. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don’t want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the “Statement Red” as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won’t be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

I mostly use this out by the pool, so I like the IP67 water rating. It’s been heavily splashed several times, with no ill effects. The battery life is excellent, and easily lasts me through a couple of days of listening. It comes with a USB-C TO USB-C charging cable.I love that this doubles as a speakerphone. I can connect it to my laptop for work calls, and the sound quality is excellent. Beats is a quintessentially Apple product, but don’t let that scare you off if you’re an Android fan like myself.

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

I have a list of songs that I listen to on any new speakers or headphones that I get. I want to hear every note from every instrument and the vocals. I want every thing to be be crisp and clear. If I cant adjust my eq to make that happen (different songs have different settings) then I dont keep it.This little speaker just sounds good. I have had beats products before and was happy with them. This is probably my favorite. It is super easy to connect to my samsung s24 ultra. As soon as I turned it on a notification showed on my phone asking if I wanted to connect it. It sent me to the play store to download the app for it and then I was listening to music.Super easy to connect. Looks great (I have the red one). Sounds really good.

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4XBB26,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it’s been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I’m chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let’s talk about the sound quality. It’s impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy – it’s deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I’ve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I’m not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I’ve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it’s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I’ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it’s a trade-off I’m happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you’re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that’s worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it’s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you’re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won’t disappoint.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4XBB26,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something “fancy.” Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don’t ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn’t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be “Stunning,” “Powerful,” or “Supercharged!(Pun intended.)” On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think…it’s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn’t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I’m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don’t have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn’t that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don’t have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven’t used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn’t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV’s come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though…that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say “really,” I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don’t think that I can ever go back to what I had…PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I’ll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I’ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you’ll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,True,80,Color: Black

I recently bought this JBL Charge 5 (new) and I couldn't be more pleased. The sound quality and quantity of the sound you get from this size of speaker is outstanding! I literally have been using it for 24hrs straight on medium volume and it's still at 80%!! It's got the JBL toughness with the Harmon performance. It looks great and works even better. I've had no issues with connectivity, even through several walls of my house it still plays the audio like I'm right there.Get a refurbished one: You will not find a speaker that's got these qualities for this price. I suggest getting a refurbished one from Amazon and save $60. I got a new one though, figured I'd spoil myself this time.Protection: The silicone cases you can purchase second hand fit great and are cheap. Great speaker, absolutely outstanding.

R20JW8VDOEC2BP,B08X4XBB26,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Mid-range Bluetooth Speaker,REDBLINKER,5,"This speaker is my 3rd JBL. I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,True,2,Color: Camouflage

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4XBB26,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,22,Color: White

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4XBB26,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,3,Color: Black

Alot of bass comes out of these little speakers. They were smaller then i had anticipated wich is good for the kayaks. But wow sound great and can be tweeked by eq in app to sound even better to your liking. They also sell accessories like carrying strap and mounts.

The speaker is waterproof and dust proof to a certain extent. I like the C drive charger which is very convenient. Saltwater and sand got on this speaker and it still performs flawlessly.

However there are better sounding speakers for the money, and some that cost far less that sound just as good(Skullcandy barrel xt for example). This boombox has great features, including TWO USB-A ports so you can use one to play music from a USB stick, and another to charge your phone, plus a mic/guitar input! For me, the battery life is hugely important, and I can not overstate how long this battery lasts and how quickly it charges back up. FAR superior to all the others I have owned. And it sounds good, not the best, but plenty good enough. I absolutely love it.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGCI7M4EX5GHPCKJUSXWLKXVMADA,True,6,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8. If you like how it looks, and are in the market for this style speaker, give it a shot.

First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,True,8,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

(Bow Hunting Skills, Numchuck skills, you know the rest....)",Natascha,5,"+The sound is amazing,+the battery life seems to last forever (especially if you turn off lights and bass boost, but even leaving them on...I'm still so impressed)+It looks super nice. I use this primarily as a home speaker actually that I move around at times, and I think it's a great speaker serving that role, too. I find it impressive truly as an ALL IN ONE product, you know? I must say, even after reviews, this speaker is better experienced in person than the reviews can even show. It's truly impressive. I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here? Well, I think for the most part yes. I think the features really are fun.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AECHBLEF5TE4MITCQKBMC4TNVGWQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues.

R1WXFJO25KJ87Y,B0B43Y8GHZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Worse sound than expected,Strikeout321,2,"We have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc…and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it’s older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there’s virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of “tinny” during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn’t sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that’s half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that’s about the most I would ever pay for it…but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you’ll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it’s stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn’t specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product.

R29N740JAMD3NA,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker with OK Battery Life,MichaelC,5,"Bought this to replace a broken Logitech Muvo 20 that I had purchased many moons ago. The general use is that it's our garage speaker, the kids use it when playing hoops and sauce toss. I also occasionally take it to the patio. Overall I think it has a much better sound than what it replaced with much heavier bass, in fact it could be a little too much for my taste with some music. The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces. I did find the battery life seems to be just ok. We are charging it more than the old speaker but it could also be that the kids are playing it louder. That aside, I think Sony has a winner here.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2023",AGUGT4SGRWIFHNNEAPQUXZPM52WQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

Sony out done themselves, if you want a portable speaker with fantastic bass and an amazing range, buy this right now!

It’s way too big I can’t even fit it in my school backpack without it using up half of the space. I would recommend a WONDERBOOM if you need something with good bass and that can fit in the schoolbackpack.

R13KMAWPNAH8OD,B0B43Y8GHZ,1.0 out of 5 stars Something Wasn't Right!!!!!,MELLY Z,1,"I'm giving one star do to the fact that I felt something was ""off"" about the speaker itself as soon as I pulled it out of the box. It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A ""RETURNED/REFURBISHED"" speaker. I own a SONY speaker and its pretty old - RDH-GTK37 which has been through three pretty big parties and my daily listening habits with nothing to complain about.Just thought ya'll should know.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AHTTJ3DUYNGE53YHQ5JOA6FG4FQA,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

RWJ5WXT4YDCW3,B07DD3W154,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Portable Speaker EVER - Here's Why!,Tyler Clark,5,"I have used and abused my Mega Boom 3s for over four years and other models even longer with nothing but success. People compare them to bose and other brands but they are incomparable and here's why. I have put these speakers through 125f summers sitting in the cab of a car pushing 140f inside. They do have a heat sensor that tells them to not turn on. So I dunked them in my ice water filled cooler for a few minutes and bam good to go. I pressure wash my sand covered golf cart with the speakers playing in the cup holders, pressure wash the speakers too, played the entire time and clean as new. I have dropped them off tailgates, coolers, ladders, still pushing. I have thrown one in a pool, still good. I mostly use them in Baghdad where I work and they push straight through the summer with impressive battery life in the heat. They sound exactly as good as the similar model bose, I compared and played two and two around a pool, but half the price and one hundred times the durability. I pair mine year-round, and now one auto-connects as the master and the other always connects as the slave every time I turn it on, so I never even have to open the app. This feature is amazing. Everyone always asks me about these speakers because they sound so good when paired offering a pool, patio, golf cart, or bedroom stereo quality sound. Truly there is no next step beyond these speakers with portability as they are the best sounding and still capable to be utilized outdoors safely. The only speakers that sound better all lose the imortality this speaker offers. I have never owned any other electronic I could literally pressure wash the dirt off, its insane. I have other models I take kayaking and abuse to mud, sand, and a LOT of water, still work like new. Biggest tip, attach a very large carabiner to the fabric loop. I hang mine from everything, everywhere, at all times. And dont get one, get two at a minimum. That is where the joy really comes in. My one complaint, the system needs a hair of time to process sound, so if you watch them with a movie they are slightly behind the video.","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2023",AG5NTKQHAEYGX2RDSB6UK77D6UBQ,True,48,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

Tried out a few and decided on this one. Love it. The size is great doesn't feel cheap. The sound though is the main thing. It doesn't have the best bass but unless you are listening to a bass heavy album or playlist you don't really notice. The best part is the volume level. It feels the room with clear sound.

Overall, sound quality, size, build quality and features is just perfect. The speaker packs an immersive sound and the size is perfect (big enough to put out rich sound but not too big, perfectly portable). Innumerable times I've let it fall, yet it only has minor cosmetic damage. Very easy controls and the app has is very simple design, with PartyUp which works amazing too (I have a Hyperboom and these two sound incredible together). The reason why I only gave it four stars is because at high levels, depending on the song obviously, this speaker tends to compress the sound so that it doesn't distorts, which makes it have volume fluctuation on the highs (when the kick hits, for example), so this sacrifices sound balance for undistorted sound. It happens only at max volume and is really not that noticeable so it doesn't affect sound quality. This is not something to worry about for general consumers though, only audiophiles like me. Battery also lasts, specially at a normal volume level. I've gone for days without charging it, using it consistently. Bluetooth connectivity easily gets interrupted with walls and other objects but range is not that bad. Definitely would buy another one to add to my collection.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AF6EIWHCKVPSDPAAOU2N2QHLTMLA,True,1,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

Just found the option in the Android app was restored, which allows turning-off the battery-draining remote-on feature!! The feature (switch) in the app is marked ""new"", so this looks like a recent development. Happy to give 5 stars now.Speaker has been rock solid for over a year, and sounds great. Had another (newer) speaker die some months back (wouldn't turn on), so happy this one is going strong.Wouldn't have been so fussy, but with these portable speakers, the battery is ""do or die"". Being fair, the battery drain wasn't ""that bad"", but was still a problem.------- Updated 6/14/2023 -------Very unhappy with Megaboom 3 now; down-rating to 2 stars (not 1) since the sound is good, but downgrading from 5 due to ""battery drain"". Apparently there is some sort of ""always on bluetooth remote"" feature that drains the battery, even when not in use. Since I only use this speaker when I want portability, this is a MAJOR SHOWSTOPPER for me.In researching, I find posts saying that the app could formerly disable this feature, but that the feature can no longer be disabled (as-of several years ago).In the future, I'll stick with JBL or Oontz. NOT happy.------- Original Review --------Very happy with my Megaboom 3. I ""drive"" it from a Samsung Android phone, with the ""rock"" EQ selected in Android settings. No EQ from Megaboom app: just flat. While I know these speakers (all brands) struggle with bass, as a bass-player that grew-up with 200W and 2x15"" speakers, I can't complain when tiny speakers struggle with the low frequencies. It's basic physics.I have nice headphones and a bigger bluetooth speaker, I never lug around, but for the small speaker I wanted for portability, it is very nice. My use-case is indoor, mid-volume. 12W probably won't ""shatter windows"" outside, but I don't need that. I certainly prefer the sound the Megaboom 3 to my Beats Studio Buds.Bonus: You can replace the battery!

It's cool that you can get it soaking wet without fear. But if you plan on using it mostly at home, and can live with your shower tunes coming from a speaker that's on the bathroom sink and not in the tub with you, I think the money is better spent elsewhere.I am willing to compromise on sound quality for a durable speaker I can take basically anywhere, but this... It's pretty rough. The bass is unrestrained and totally dominates the rest of the music. The treble just can't keep up. Even using the in-app EQ (which is surprisingly nice) is not enough. Vocal transients vanish, the crack of the snare drum turns into a thud, and distorted guitars become a total cacophony when played through this speaker. Maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic, but it's bad enough that it's annoying and totally takes the fun out of listening for me.If you're an unpicky listener, it probably won't sound horrible to your ear. If you don't really listen with intent and use music as background noise, this speaker is perfectly functional. But if you have a critical ear, you will definitely be able to hear the sound quality issues of this device right off the bat without doing any A/B comparison. And sitting down and doing A/B between this and any other thing you own will make you return this product like I'll be doing.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. It uses a micro USB cable, and that's not even the most frustrating thing about the cable. The plastic over molding on the micro end of the cable has square corners. The place on the speaker where the cable goes is recessed, and has round corners. The included cable does fit, but only just barely, and it's fiddly to get it connected.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AHVCPW25AL7KB5PXOCULYIS2IPTA,True,1,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3

This thing floats! I love it. No fear at all taking this thing boating.I got it for $130 and at that price is a good value. It lacks the bass and volume of a higher quality mid range speaker such as Sonos Move or Bose Portable, but at moderate volume, it's fidelity rivals that of those speakers at a third of their price.The ethics of buying stuff made in this product's country of origin is getting dicier by the day...that's my biggest hangup with this speaker. It could be made elsewhere and keep my conscience clear, but, business degrees only care about money in pocket right now. That said, if you are paying more than $130...I think the juice vs squeeze equation is less favorable.This product's reliance on the app is also questionable (have since discovered I can use it as a bluetooth speaker without the app--score!). What else is being compromised because I have to use an app to use a bluetooth speaker? This is probably one of those things that I will regret five years down the road. Frustrating in that regard. You shouldn't need a burner phone to enjoy music.The lack of microphone is somewhat of a drawback too.

R2UZPAXLA8L9JK,B07DD3W154,3.0 out of 5 stars I really wanted to like it,design guy,3,"I have been on the hunt for finding the perfect bluetooth speaker for my needs.UE makes great stuff. I first tried their hyperboom which was an awesome speaker that sounded great. It's just pretty big and cumbersome. Great for if you don't wanna move it around a lot.I downsized to this one. The size is perfect and has been great in many different scenarios. You can really toss it around and not be concerned with damaging it at all. The fit and finish is top notch along with the form factor.Right out of the box though I wasn't very impressed with the sound quality. They advertise ""thundering bass"" or whatever, but I was underwhelmed even with the most bass heavy songs with the speaker placed in a corner to help reverberate the sound.I figured it might just need some breaking in before it starts to sound better, but after a couple weeks of using it every day it had no change in sound quality.Overall it really doesn't sound horrible, but I'm picky with my audio and speakers and headphones, etc. It's probably fine for the vast majority of people out there.After almost a month of using it, it started to develop some pretty bad distortion on the bass when played at even medium volumes. Some songs were exceptionally bad with the low end distortion.I had not used the speaker in any water or had it ever been submerged so I can rule that out as to a possible cause to it.I also feel that after a month of using it, the battery life doesn't seem to be what it first was out of the box. Maybe this is because I'm using it louder environments where it needs to be played slightly louder, but this is just my observation.I really wanted to like this speaker, but I've moved on to now try the anker soundcore motion boom with higher hopes.Edit: been a couple weeks with the soundcore motion boom and I can say this speaker is miles better than the megaboom. That is once you tweak the sound profile in the 7 band adjustable eq in the phone app.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2022",AHLKLQ77YIU3UX74EVQ4MMMAC54Q,True,14,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3

R3NV0CNBS5BVV8,B07DD3W154,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Bad UI",Mr. Litwin,3,"I used to be a big Ultimate Ears guy from the aughts before they were bought by Logitech who killed their best product lines and replaced it with stuff like... THIS. The tiresome photos of impossibly gleeful adult-babies listening to music underwater and having the times of their lives thanks to this f——g speaker really gets cloying when it’s printed on literally everything except the device itself. But that’s Logitech for you. Of all things I have to complain about with this speaker, the sound isn’t one of them. Unlike its predecessors and smaller cousins, the Megaboom 3 doesn’t peak out the bass quite so much when it would otherwise be distorted. (This is the most common bit of digital audio gimmickry to fool you into think it sounds “crystal clear”.) The people complaining about this speaker in these reviews who say other brands are better are just brands more notorious for “loudness fakery” to make the sound seem more bass-heavy but is really just slick audio post-processing. It’s makes hip hop sound a little better but everything else is a murky mess. But I digress. This speaker does all of the digital trickery, sure, but at least the actual amplifier and speaker drivers aren’t rubbish so that’s I plus. I was playing System of a Down cranked in my bedroom and it sounded amazing, especially compared to my former Boom speaker which someone nicked from my garage. Where the Boo crumpled trying to product screeching highs and thumping lows the Megaboom 3 dominated. Of course I don’t use any of the EQ tomfoolery and let it play as close to how the music was engineered to play and its just dandy. Okay then, good sound: check.The problem with this speaker, like all of the other UE speakers, is the brain-dead user interface and obnoxious audio feedback that you can’t properly adjust without hacking the device configs (allegedly). There is literally a single on/off switch for all audio feedback. Wut? No relative volume of system sounds compared to music, or selection of which sounds you want to hear and which ones you don’t, like that HORRIBLY OBNOXIOUS LOUD BEEP it makes that’s louder than the music if you accidentally lean in on your volume up button? Of course every sound is as loud as or louder than the music your playing. That’s just great. Furthermore, if you are listening to music through your iPad or iPhone, it decides to insert little beeps for certain feedback notifications that never happen when you are just using your device without the speaker. It’s horribly distracting and unnecessary, but worse is that you NEED audio feedback on if you want to be able to Bluetooth connect to it as audio feedback is the only feedback you get.Ugh. Sorry, had a bit of a rant there.It’s tough because I think the speak sounds decent and almost worth the price, but the UI team at Logite... excuse me... Ultimate Ears are clearly huffing paint fumes as each product they subsequently release is even more unpleasant to use than the last. Don’t let the coked-out looking teens with bright, expensive clothing printed on the box fool you.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2019",AH55KUF7LM5AV7FG6VRZFIHGXK6A,True,152,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3
R28WEDN1X72UJ6,B07DD3W154,3.0 out of 5 stars Read this if you intend connect to ome than one speaker,Amazon Customer,3,"This small unit puts quality sound out there well beyond its size, and if you buy a single unit, it connects simply to any Bluetooth. Just pair it to a phone or computer, and it works after you've pressed the Bluetooth button on the speaker. But … if you're impressed enough to get a second speaker to hear all in stereo, you'll need some advice, which you'll not get from Ultimate Ears.Do not first connect one or both speakers to your phone and then later connect them to your computer to test things out because the speakers have a tiny little brain and seem to remember what they've been connected to in the past and get confused when Bluetooth pairings have been left on.To connect the speakers to your phone, remove all other Bluetooth connections to the speakers. Play music on your phone. Switch one speaker ON (it becomes the master speaker … consider marking it somehow), and ensure the other is OFF. Pair this speaker to your phone by pressing the Bluetooth button on the master speaker. It should fire up. Now switch ON the second (slave) speaker. To connect the slave speaker to the master, press the '+' and Bluetooth buttons simultaneously on the 'master' for 5 secs or so until the master says 'tum-tum-tum' and its Bluetooth light flashes, which says I am ready to pair. Now press the Bluetooth button twice fairly quickly on the slave speaker… like click.click not click ….. click (if it pairs with the master, its Bluetooth light should flash … if not … double press the slave speaker's Bluetooth button again). When its Bluetooth button flashes, leave the slave speaker alone. It will connect in 10 secs or so.If you switch a paired computer on while playing from your phone, the music will stop because the computer screws up the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the speaker, and the speaker becomes confused.If confused switch both speakers off, disconnect Bluetooth pairings that are not needed, and repeat the process.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",AGEPODLDFFH7LPZRF3YJEWPXQHAQ,True,18,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

R22E5M0I3DEGI0,B07DD3W154,"2.0 out of 5 stars A glimmer of potential, but incredibly overrated and laughably overpriced for a barely usable sound",Skylar,2,"As a starter audiophile I tend to take my music very seriously. Especially as a metal fan, the music of which tends to involve a lot of complex and various elements going on all at once within a given sound, I have learned to really have a keen ear as to what I want to hear in a speaker. Getting into highly dynamic music, my search for a Bluetooth speaker that at least comes close to the quality of my Audio Technica ATH M50xs is a recent one and, unfortunately, one that has not given me any success so far. The JBL Charge 4, my last experience with a speaker (as well as a Charge 3 before that), was pretty good and could handle a lot of volume, but I always felt that the sound distorted a little bit when pushed up high (something which can be easily avoided), and in my search, this particular speaker was often regarded to be a ""high-end"", ""premium"", ""great sounding"" speaker, and in one case someone directly referenced it as superior to the Charge 3 and 4. Intrigued, I decided to invest in one.Unfortunately, my experience has been less than ""high-end"". Getting past a certain volume level meant for outdoor use (I work an outside warehouse with a lot of machinery running), the sound distorts heavily, especially in the lower frequencies, which is where I'm going to guess the speaker gets the name ""Megaboom"", because it does boom like a MF, but not in a GOOD way, because on certain bass-heavy production jobs on some albums the bass vibrates in a very unpleasant way that reminds one somewhat of a blown speaker. Which, in fact, I previously bought one off of eBay and it was incredibly BLOWN when I got it. I returned it, and finding someone with the same model, it sounded a lot better on theirs. So I figured, y'know, I just got a bad unit, Ill order a brand new one. But this one was barely even marginally better. Even toning down to some electronic music and lighter rock, which I am also into, the sound still was barely salvageable, to the point where I almost wasnt enjoying listening to it. And mind you, all this was also including tweaking the EQ settings, updating the software for the speaker (which you must do with their app after getting it as it prompts you to, I use an Android), and FACTORY RESETTING IT to try to fix a charging problem. It's only when I have the speaker at HALF OR LOWER volume that it starts to sound ""better"".Which brings me to the other major issue. The battery life. I dont know what the deal with this thing is, but on the first day after blasting it I needed to charge it after 4 hours. Which, ok, I didnt really care cause I know they test the battery life on these things with certain types of music at certain volume levels, but regardless, that ""20 hours battery life"" claim? BFS, don't believe it, unless you're only going to be using it at slightly below half volume, indoors, and even then its tricky. After that, I was literally using the speaker for 20 MINUTES and being told ""critical battery, please charge"". This was when I found out about the supposed ""factory reset"" solution, but it doesn't seem to have worked for me so far.As far as durability, its fine. It withstands dust and slight water contact fine. Which is honestly the only real strength I can give this thing at this point.Its in times like this that I curse the day I ever got into high-end audio, because when something is marketed as ""super premium"" and seems to get passed around like the word of God, I now have to be wary of what I buy and what sales-talk I hear, because what they market these types of speakers on these days is horrendous. This speaker could do with a heavy overhaul, ESPECIALLY with the price they're asking. Im just glad I only got the $175 red model, and not the other $200 colors (why so expensive???). Currently getting customer support for the battery problem, but honestly Im going to be returning this and looking for something else. This gets a no from me. Get the JBL Charge 4 if you want something similar in price with a (somewhat) better value for the money. The Charge 4 is roughly $150, btw.Thank God/Satan/Buddha for return policies.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2019",AHQMP6J3CLWGOFO3QQQQXTD6Q2IQ,True,6,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3

Audio sounds good, but I don't like how I *had* to install an app for it. But here's the reason why I cannot give this 5 stars. Micro-USB charging port.

It will also help with sustainability as so many other devices use that style port and charger.I'm updating this rating after having this speaker for ~9 months. The audio is amazing, outside of the charging port like I said above, my only other issue with this is there's a SERIOUS battery drain when not in use. I can not use the speaker for a few weeks and I turn it on and it's low on battery. and plugging it in to charge while using it is not an option.

The crisp, powerful sound will leave you instantly addicted. And with an incredible battery life, it will not shut off on its own either so be prepared to lose your job and maybe even your family because you can't stop listening. Luckily, it is very portable (fits snuggly in a backpack bottle holder and has a loop to clip onto) so I find it convenient to take around the house, gym, and for recreational activities.I work out in a large gym; but with the mighty sound of this musical beauty, I can leave the speaker in the middle of the weightroom without worrying about it being too quiet. Using the Megaboom 3 made me the king of the gym and gave me my own ""Iron Throne"". For you bass fiends like myself, have no doubts the Megaboom 3 is everything its name indicates it is. The reverbating bass can pulse through your body like an adrenaline rush. Even at high volume, I have heard no bass distortion. What amazes me is that a speaker with amazing bass can also it all the high notes/tones just as well.The speaker pairs extremely quickly and the Megaboom mobile app can be really useful for turning the speaker on/off remotely and controlling EQ. The speaker's physical beauty from it's slick sheen puts all the IG models that you probably follow to shame.I have so far enjoyed EDM, hip-hop, pop, country, rock, and epic dramatic music with it, and all genres benefit from the amazing sound quality of the Megaboom 3. This beautiful speaker is worth the price and more. But if you are someone who has low self-esteem, go ahead, settle for a lower-priced speaker..you probably don't care about yourself or your listening experience anyways. Know that every time you turn your peasant speaker on, you'll wish you had the incredible Megaboom 3.Update: I have used this speaker for 2 years now and it still works amazingly with wonderful sound and great battery life.

However our recent speaker lasted short of 2yrs before the Bluetooth function just stopped working - it will not connect to anything anymore rendering it close to useless.We purchased a different $67 popular off brand speaker on Amazon with good reviews. Listened to music on it once and sent it straight back, it sounded like utter horse poo. UE Megaboom has the quality sound and is worth the money. We are going to purchase our 3rd Megaboom today but are hoping the Bluetooth issue does not repeat. We may just have to face the fact that electronics now a days aren't meant to last 2yrs but my first speaker sure did, so Ill hold out hope!","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2023",AEASEWT7ZWNFWOPSW7QI5PT2XUJQ,True,10,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3
R28VGQRLRZPHRO,B07DD3W154,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent portable option,Jerry,5,"I have owned several Bluetooth speakers over the years and this one wins for most well rounded. I came to the Megaboom as my primary BT speaker from a JBL Charge 4 (which my son now uses). While the JBL is more bass heavy, the megaboom provides a more well rounded sound accenting the middle and high frequencies while still providing ample bass. The megaboom also seems to be louder (although I didn’t run a side by side test on volume). As with all smaller speakers the megaboom really shines when placed against a wall or in an alcove to help the bass. My only complaint (and it’s minor) is that the upright cylinder style makes it kinda hard to place it on various outdoor surfaces. Oh - the app makes adjusting the sound very easy although I find the flat adjustment to be most realistic. Also, you definitely want to look into a charging base if you are going to be moving it around as the single line input gets cumbersome.Overall, recommended.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2023",AEY47PXDT37Z753D27ETGLI4633Q,True,5,Color: Lagoon BlueStyle: MEGABOOM 3

I have an Oontz that provides huge bang for the buck. The Megaboom 3 is clearly better, but 5-7x better? Probably not.I also bought a Bose Soundlink Flex and decided to return the Megaboom 3 and keep the Soundlink. I'm not a Bose fan at all, but side by side, the Bose had a warmer sound with more separation especially in the mids (surprising since I usually find Bose pretty harsh). Bass was equivalent--which is to say not very good unless you take into account the size of these things, then quite remarkable.It could be this gets louder than the Soundlink--I don't really know since I listen at moderate levels and both were plenty loud for me.Bottom line on smallish portable speakers: bigger is almost always better wrt sound. You absolutely will not get meaningful bass out of anything this size. But sometimes portability is more important. Given that standard, the Soundlink beats the Megaboom 3, but not by a huge amount.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2022",AHX2EMAM25EZR3TRU2SQMV6WAR2A,True,3,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

R128MJPYBHANMO,B07DD3W154,5.0 out of 5 stars Best speaker of it's kind out of 8 that I've tried.,SkiGator,5,"The Megaboom 3 is a rugged, relatively waterproof speaker with great sound & ability to play fairly loud. It's not the smallest portable bluetooth out there, but it's size was still convenient enough to take along on two ski trips with me this winter. I've purchased & returned 7 different portable bluetooth outdoor speakers over the last year, & found this to be the best of the bunch..(Tried the UE Wonderboom, several Altec-Lansing models, Bose & a others that I've already forgotten the names).It's not the cheapest model out there, but I think I got my money's worth for the $200 I paid. The bluetooth range on this is far better than the speakers priced up to $100 or so. Like most bluetooth devices, you'll get some dead spots when moving it around inside & outside the house. but it's easy to work around that.The only feature I don't like is it always tells me to download the app & have internet connectivity to use all it's features. I haven't bothered to download the app, & besides that, who always has internet connectivity? Other than the annoying voice telling me to do that, & the inability to turn it off without the app, I've had no problems with it. To turn it off, I simply stop my bluetooth signal & the speaker turns off less than 5 mintues later.As to battery life, I've had it going for 6 or 7 hours at a moderate volume. Cant' say that I've had it at maximum volume for more than a couple of hours, however.All & all, this is a really GREAT speaker. It's not perfect, but what is?

R3LZZ2BNQNY41C,B07DD3W154,3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable,JB,3,"So I needed an outdoor speaker for the backyard and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a dedicated system. I have the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable for inside use, and it did an awesome job when I was testing it in my backyard. Problem is I have kids who will drop it, beat it up, leave it out in the rain, and so on, so I didn't want to expose the Bose to all of that danger. After reading lots of reviews, I decided this UE Megaboom 3 would be my next best option. After using the Bose prior to this, this did not live up to my expectations. The Megaboom 3 has decent high and mid-frequency sound, but the bass is very very lacking. For being version 3 of something called ""megaboom"" I expected a whole heck of a lot more. And yes, I got this new in retail box from Amazon proper, not a refurb or knockoff from a shady reseller. The problem with not having a lot of bass is the music just doesn't sound as full or fleshed-out, so it's kind of weak and disappointing when listening to most music types, including pop, rock, classical, occasional hip hop, etc. For the cost of this speaker, I expected a lot better compared to other bluetooth speakers I've heard for substantially less money.If your goal is great quality outdoor music on a deck, patio, or back yard, I would steer you towards the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable, with the knowledge that it is admittedly more expensive and less rugged. If you can keep it covered up or take it in with you when you're done, you'll be much happier spending the extra money on this one.If your goal is ruggedness with an acceptable loss of bass and deeper, richer music, then this would likely work for you.For what it's worth, I am actually keeping this unit since at the end of the day I need something tough that will take a beating, which I hope this will do (time will tell).","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2019",AE6V2XVCG7Z7AWA5GAE33323WHGQ,True,5,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3

R3BSUBFTORQSQY,B07DD3W154,1.0 out of 5 stars Speaker unusable due to known bug UE refuses to fix,Keegan Clinton,1,"To start, I have a UE Wonderboom which I got back in 2017. That thing still runs today beautifully. The battery doesn't last as long as when I got it, but other than that no complaints whatsoever.It was because of my Wonderboom that I decided to get the Megaboom 3. Unfortunately, this speaker is rendered useless due to playback/firmware issues. Playback is stopped constantly at which point the speaker repeats the same message over and over ""to use this feature, make sure your app is running and connected to internet"". This issue began on the first day of using this speaker but at the start would happen once or twice a day. Since then it has consistently gotten worse and worse to the point where the speaker is now unusable.I have found no way of stopping this. Turning off all sharing features in the app, hard resetting the speaker & even running the speaker without ever installing the app all proved fruitless. The speaker will cut out every 10-15 seconds to repeat the same message and pause the music. You have to manually restart the music only for it to do the same thing by the time you've put the phone back down. The speaker is rendered useless by this constant bug. The ""Magic"" button will start flashing randomly as if it is trying to connect to something and then pause the music to deliver the news that the thing you're not trying to do can't be done.This is a known issue, there are numerous posts all over Reddit & other forums discussing this issue with no one seeming able to find a fix. It seems like this should be a pretty simple firmware update that we should be able to install, yet the first post I saw of this issue dates back to 2019. This has been an issue for people for 4 years & UE has still not sent a patch. Seems like they aren't too concerned by this.I would avoid & look elsewhere for a speaker. While it's physically well built & sounds good, the speaker really is unusable due to this bug.","Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2023",AG4LF5UGUSAAZQXUNSFCBPCSP3RA,True,3,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

Tried out the EQ and something was off. I swiped back to Standard and the speaker came back to life. Hmm, all I did was bump the bass and treble so I reset the Custom and as soon as I made the sliders go up at all the thing threw a limiter at me and dropped the loudness instantly. It's a really aggressive limiter but if the goal is to make sure you never distort the speaker it will achieve that at the compromise of getting the sound you want at the same volume. So, if you think your speaker sounds quiet, you probably touched the EQ. Put it back to standard and listen how much louder it is.The audio person in me says HANDS OFF UE, but as a product designer – ugh, I get it. Majority will never notice, care or think anything negative of their experience using it. I'd say that last sentence is important to remember in your decision as this speaker is extremely well built, sounds great, floats and will not disappoint.Docking a star for the heavy handed DSP being used but if an update brings the ability to go into an advanced mode I'll change that.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2018",AHRZDXZRX4L3D6L7AEA6PXVUKPCA,True,205,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3

R2PF2WLR41KJR6,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Audiophiles on a Budget,Caleb Roden,5,"This is the best speaker for the money out there. I have owned this for 3 years and have taken it everywhere, never missing a beat… (Yes pun)…The sound quality on this is pretty good out of the box but some EQ’ing on the app makes this really come alive with a vibrant sound. I cannot emphasize enough how much improvement a makes for this portable speaker. For me, this really loves a V shaped EQ as the mids are pretty forward and dominant out of the box. The hardware itself is great but the tuning is pretty average out of the box. If you don’t mind dialing it in yourself, it is well worth the 5-10 minutes it takes to set it and forget it. This has a pretty wide range for such a moderately sized speaker. This speaker boasts a generous capacity for bass and has excellent sound separation. It seems to have 2 mid-range drivers, 2 high range, and one “sub.” I initially used this as a little soundbar for my desktop pc but now it is my daily driver. I have used it nearly every day for 3 years and it has been rocksteady the whole while. The battery life is still excellent too.Back to the EQ, this benefits from a bit of extra sub bass, generous mid bass amplification and moderate upper mids and treble. With that set up, this little guy really becomes vibrant.Being a smaller speaker, the bass is obviously going to be somewhat limited but for the size it is surprisingly present. I would describe the bass as present, clean, and generally responsive.For durability I may not be the best person to ask because I’m generally pretty protective of this thing but it has been in a backpack hundreds of times and even dropped a few slight drops. Other than a small dent from one such drop there is no real sign of wear.All in all I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants the best possible sound quality for the money!","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AGVTW4JTHAFPLMM6EQNFZ5XAL6IQ,True,4,Color: Black
R1QXBHCR4TIS7G,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds very good with app/EQ,von Diesel,5,"Out of the box, the sound lacks bass and some highs. Downloading the app and tweaking the EQ makes these speakers really sing. I put on some Steely Dan and played with the EQ for 5 minutes and then they were good to go. They remember the previous EQ setting when you next use them, so you don't have to adjust every time.I bought two so I could pair them into stereo mode. They sound good and produce stereo sound alone, but two together is quite impressive.These are replacing an old pair of JBL Flip 4's. The Flips were fine, but the battery life was fading. I would use them at moderate volume about an hour per day, and I would have to charge twice a week. The new Motion+ are a bit larger, louder, sound better, and the battery life is 2-3X longer.Overall excellent speakers for the price so far. No Bluetooth connection problems and they seem to be solid and high quality. Highly recommended if you're willing to get the Soundcore app and tweak the EQ for a few minutes. I uploaded a photo of my settings. Try making yours similar to mine and see how it goes.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AGHBCHZUKT423NPUVBUDNJRJUQ7Q,True,14,Color: Black

R3I7YEMYIPDPT3,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker, has some fixable issues",CheezyWeezle,4,"The speaker itself is very good, has a lot of power for the size and I can usually crank it up to 100% without any clipping and almost no distortion if any at all (after adjusting the EQ settings... more on that later). The layout of the drivers and the fact that there are 5 of them in this tiny package absolutely fills the sound stage and the DSP does a very good job of balancing the power between them all. The battery lasts quite a while: long enough for a day trip or party multiple times over, and it doesn't seem to lose much charge when unused for a few days at a time. The portability is fine, it is a bit heavy and decently large, so you won't be putting it in your pocket and can't really comfortably hold it in your hands for more than a few minutes, but that's probably not what you would be buying a speaker like this for anyways.That said, I do have a few issues, some of which are major and should be extremely easy to fix (and I honestly am surprised that anyone in this day and age would leave these features out), these issues being that 1. Every time you turn on the speaker, it defaults to it's god awful ""Bass Up"" aka ""Destroy the sound quality"" EQ that makes everything sound TERRIBLE. When I first got this speaker, turned it on, and played something, I heard the awful cacophony and immediately turned the speaker off and put it back in the box, ready to return it. Then I remembered I read a review that said the default EQ was awful and that the app allows you to change it, and changing it to anything other than the ""Bass Up"" or ""Bass Off"" (Bass off sounds like the awful cacophony but without any bass) makes this speaker absolutely shine. The problem with this solution? You HAVE to have it connected to your phone, and you HAVE to use the app to change the EQ, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TURN ON THE SPEAKER. On the speaker itself, you can switch between ""Bass Up"" and ""Bass Off"", but you cannot set a default EQ, you cannot save a custom EQ from the 9-band custom EQ, and you cannot disable the ""Bass Up"" from being defaulted on every time you turn on the speaker. Because the speaker sounds so awful out of the box, I have given 4 stars in the ""Sound Quality"" feature, but if you change the EQ the sound quality goes up to 5 stars for sure.Another rather large issue is that it is currently impossible to use the speaker over Bluetooth with Windows 10. The device will only show up as ""Unknown device"" if it even shows up at all, and if you manage to connect to it, it will indeed name itself to Soundcore Motion+ but it does not recognize it as an audio device and you cannot use it to play sounds through. For me, this isn't a huge deal because I use the aux input when using the speaker with my computer, but I can image that this issue would impact others rather significantly.The other issues I have had are rather minor. For example, if you have the Volume Sync bluetooth feature enabled, you can only change the volume in it's predefined steps, so if one notch is too quiet, and the next notch up is too loud, you just have to deal with it and choose quiet or loud (If you disable Volume Sync, you can granularly change the volume through the Soundcore app, but then the speaker volume is independent of your device volume). Another one is that I feel that the rubber stopper that covers the ports has a rather clunky design, and while I appreciate that it is rather large to accommodate the waterproof feature, I feel like it sticks out quite a lot and gets in the way if you want to use an aux or charge it while you are using it. Also, I had a very bad experience with the firmware update, as it apparently must have at least 50% battery remaining (remember, it has a rather beefy battery and absolutely did not come anywhere near needing 50% battery, I'd say 15-20% is a more realistic limit) and also apparently takes an exorbitantly long time to update the firmware (about 15 minutes to install, I had already downloaded the measly 36MB update before it would have made a difference) while neglecting to tell you that it is going to take that long until AFTER you have already starting the update and cannot cancel it without risking bricking the thing. If I had any warning that it was going to take more than a minute, I would have waited until later so I could have used it during my break at work, instead of waiting for it to update.Now to round it off with a few more good things about the device: it turns on quickly and automatically connects to my phone instantly. It takes about 3 seconds to turn on and another second or two to connect via bluetooth. It also does NOT play any sort of sound when changing or maxing out the volume, a feature I absolutely despise in other speakers. You can also charge the speaker while using it. The Bluetooth 5.0 features are quite nice as well. The build quality is fantastic; it feels extremely solid and looks like it could take a beating.TL;DR: The speaker is great, sounds great, and has great battery life, but it has a few caveats in the feature functionality, such as poor EQ out of the box and a bug causing incompatibility with bluetooth connection to Windows 10.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2020",AFUPIW4BXLOBZXBG7CEP235UWBFA,True,17,Color: Black
RSATCQM413XZR,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars BT connection problem : But GREAT CUSTOEMR SERVICE & Problem Solved,Alex Y. Yoon,5,"UPDATE : 10/21/2020Problem Solved. Anker/Soundcore has contacted me and they have resolved the problem for me.A great company and products. As long as there is a good customer service and they can guaranty their products, I can buy their products without worries. Thanks AnkerUPDATE : 10/11/2020I have been using this for few days. Initially, I have connected to my 3 devices. my laptop, amazon fire and my cell phone. supposedly, when I turn on soundcore, it should be automatically connect to the previous device. That it does. however, the main problem is that while playing, the music gets cut off, trying to connect to my other two devices. So basically, either I have to turn off my two other device bluetooth features or keep reconnecting the main device which is my laptop to listen to music.I have many other Anker/soundcore bluetooth speakers but none of them has this sort of problem, except this Motion + which is very strange to me.so, I have to return the product and lower the stars from 5 to 1 stars.other complain is the bass. I am not a bass head, but surprisingly it does lack a lot of bass compared to my previous speakers, Earfun. Mid and high are pretty good, but bass is still bit weak.lastly, battery life does not come close to what it advertises. about 30% less than what it advertises.bit of disappointment.===============================================I always have been a big fan of Anker for many years. I believe that I have bought at least 50 products from them since five years ago. Before this purchase, I had Earfun bluetooth speakers. I bought two of them to use as stereo home system. They worked great and sounded even better.....for about two weeks and a half. then, one of them went kaputt. No power, no charging, just simply dead without any reason whatsoever.so, I had to look for another one.I always had my eyes on this Soundcore Motion + because of a lot of good reviews in youtube and I normally trust their quality and customer service.Fortunately, this one was on deal of the day at $69.99 So I picked it up right away.Just by the weight, it is heavy and I could tell that this has a lot of battery to play for a long time and it just felt good in my hand. Everything looked substantial and fit & finish was top notch.As for the sound quality, Yes, it is good. very refined high and clear mid/vocal along with decent bass. (but bit weak compared to mid/high)However, what made me to give 5 stars was the soundcore app. I was able to control the frequencies with my phone soundcore app. That was a huge point because not all music can be played at same frequency setting.However, I don't think that this motion + can produce 30 watts as advertised. it seems a lot low.....but it is okay. Loud enough.I know that it is the first day and normally I always am eager to put my review on Amazon. Just like the Earfun, perhaps in a week or two, it might go bad. If so, then I will update my review. But my initial impression is very impressive.Thanks Soundcore.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020",AGGIR5S4YQMG4IKWU3A7K3BQ56ZA,True,4,Color: Black

Anyway, when I first spotted these things on Amazon, I just knew that I had to have one (and then 2 more after I got 1 of them).Pros:1) Really really great sound out of these things even with the BassUp feature ""OFF"".2) For larger rooms turning ""ON"" the BassUp features helps just enough with the bass in larger rooms without bogging down the sound.3) Tight punchy bass with or without the BassUp feature ""ON"".4) Mids & highs sound fantastic, very clear with great instrument separation.5) Pairing 2 speakers together makes these sound even better for increased stereo separation and fullness of sound—and the BassUp feature isn't needed as much when using 2 speakers.6) Beautiful design, it's the best looking speaker that Anker has made to date, in my opinion.7) IPX7 rated...so it's completely waterproof.8) USB-C charging and cable (I think that the first charging time on one of mine was about 3.5 hours but charge faster with a better socket adapter, or so I hear).9) Still has an 3.5mm stereo auxiliary jack and supplied cable.10) Battery level indicator shows up on my iPod even without Soundcore Motion application installed.11) Decent battery life (12 hours) however, one of mine, so far (haven't tested the others yet), has exceeded the 12 hour mark. I listen to it just below half volume and this is usually enough volume for me.12) This speaker sounds better and is louder than the Soundcore Pro (the most comparable equivalent to this speaker).13) You can turn the BassUp feature ""ON"" and ""OFF"" with this Motion Plus speaker but you can't do that with the Soundcore Pro.14) There is an application download for this speaker that I hear has some nice features on it but you can still pair it up with another speaker to get a right & left channel stereo paring without the app.—totally unlike the JBL flip 4s and JBLs which require their app to get their pair speakers out of ""Party Mode"".15) It's a little wider physically than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost so the stereo separation is still a little better than other models, even without having to pair it to another speaker,POTENTIAL cons but ONLY if these things are important to you (they are usually NOT a problem for me):1) Although, it has good battery life the Soundcore Pro (another Anker model) has an 8000 milliamp battery (18 hours of battery life) and this one is only a 6700 milliamp battery. It might have been nice to get a little bit of a bigger battery in the Motion but it's not that disappointing to me that we didn't.2) The Soundcore Pro has a standard USB port so you can charge your phone from the speaker. (This is not important to me as I would rather just carry an extra Anker battery charging bank to charge my phone rather than use the speaker's battery.)3) It doesn't have quite as much bass as the Soundcore Pro—if you're primarily into really heavy bass, which I am NOT. This is NOT a con for me personally because I think that the Motion Plus has the perfect amount of bass with or without the BassUp turned ""ON"". I found that I always needed to EQ down the bass on the Soundcore Pro to get it where I personally liked it. I don't have to do that with this speaker.4) This speaker is larger or wider than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost; so if you're looking for something really small, this speaker might not be quite as easy to carry around as the Boost or Pro. (This is not a problem for me at all though; I actually like this feature a lot.)5) No multi light battery indicator on the actual speaker itself—but the power button does start flashing red when batteries are getting low. (It would have been nice to have battery level lights on the speaker but I am still okay with it showing up just on the iPod and/or on the application.)6) Has sizable quantized volume increases for every click of the volume button however, these increases are NOT nearly as bad as the larger jumps in volume on the Soundcore Pro.Only 3 of these potential cons represented any problem for me:* the battery play time* no battery level indicator lights on speaker* the sizable volume increasesHowever, these issues still haven't seemed to have been that big of a deal so far because I get more than the expected battery time because the speaker is loud enough so I can just listen to it at lower volumes and get longer battery life that way. Also, I can track battery levels on my device and/or application so this isn't much of an issue with me. And as far as the sizable volume increase, I seem to be able to micro adjust them when using my finger along the slider (at least with the newer iPods and iPhones, older ones seem a bit more jumpy).Anyway, this is a really great speaker and I highly recommend it!!!NOTE: If you like your mids and highs scaled back some, then I would highly recommend the Soundcore Boost and if you really like a lot of bass with a dip in the mids, I would then recommend the Soundcore Pro. All 3 of these are good speakers though.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2020",AGZ5Q5UNZ5WCHTCT5TX3DWABJIMQ,True,23,Color: Black
R19XDNHSZB3ZH1,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars The Audiophiles Choice,Russell B.,5,"The Soundcore Motion+ is an elegant design with excellent ergonomics that elevates this speaker above & beyond. It feels substantial in your hand and well built. The volume controls located on the top of the speaker are perfectly centered between the bass drivers on either side, and the front passive radiator which allows for easy navigation. Technically, the Motion+ excels with an AKM DSP featuring active crossovers for its four amps, each with its own dedicated power supply, silk dome tweeters (which I believe are Scan-Speak design), bass drivers with large neodymium magnets coupled to two passive radiators and USB-C charging. It’s a brilliant design that is supremely executed. Hats off to the sound engineers that collaborated on this speaker! Once you’ve unboxed and charged your Motion+ you’ll want to update the firmware and set up the custom EQ. To do that you’ll have to download the app. To use Ankers Soundcore App, you’ll have to accept giving up a huge amount of personal data analytics, so I chose to install the app on a tablet. Just beware. The Soundcore Motion+ will save your custom eq setting, however, you’ll want to delete the Soundcore app and re download it to verify that the settings are correct. The app will lower the sliders if they’re in between whole dB’s. Once it’s dialed in, you shouldn’t have to open the Soundcore app again. You'll want to refrain from pushing the bass up button on the top left of the speaker, since that bumps you off your Custom eq setting. The only way to get back to your saved eq preset is from the Soundcore app. I set the 9 bands of equalization all below flat to give the digital amplifiers extra headroom, keeping any audible distortion at bay. See attached photo. Since this speaker isn’t a three way and audible distortion is most prevalent at 1kHz, I set that band to -5 dB. Next is the lower and higher mid ranges at 700 Hz and 5kHz which I set to -4dB. 500Hz and 8kHz are at -3dB while 300Hz and 12kHz are at -2dB. Lastly, keeping the bass strong, I’ve set 80 & 150Hz at -1dB. So how does it sound? It’s airy and open projecting a surprisingly effective stereo image thanks to its silk dome tweeters mounted at the outside corners and tilted at a 15* angle. It’s balanced and capable with all genres of music from EDM to jazz, reggae to heavy metal. Horns, piano and vocals are beautifully rendered by the tweeters, juxtaposed by the bass capabilities of this speakers dual passive radiators. On Spotify, Amazon and Apple Music under shared playlists is my favorite titled:Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul.Some stand out tracks from Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul that sound fantastic on the Motion+ are:“Angels (Feat. Nora Jones) Thievery Corporation Remix” Wax Poetic- Norah’s voice floats around the room, amazing stereo separation. “Lips Like Sugar (Way Out West Remix Edit)-Echo & The Bunnymen- Punchy drums combined with some killer bass lines and melodic synth combined with sexy lyrics and a memorable rhythm guitar, this track sounds great blasted all the way! “Radiation Ruling the Nation(Protection)- Massive Attack. Even at max the on purpose distortion in this track sounds so authoritative! “I Want You (John Morales M+M Main Mix)-Marvin Gaye. This 9:36 long Masterpiece, highlighted by bongos, piano and saxophone are easily distinguished in the mix, throw in Marvin’s amazing tone, and man is this song better than the original? I think so. An analog 3.5mm jack is provided for those times when Bluetooth is not an option, however sound quality is best when left in the digital domain given the Motion+’s DSP. Speaker placement is important for the Soundcore Motion+ to sound it’s best. A solid surface such as a granite counter top, placed near a back wall, or corner placement can help accentuate the low end punch of the Motion+. A helpful hint is to hover the speaker in whatever area you’ve chosen and place the speaker when the bass moves your hand the most. Placing the speaker just inches one way or another can have a dramatic effect! This speaker excels indoors in moderate sized rooms, and can sometimes struggle in larger rooms or when played outside. The Motion+ puts out some serious SPL’s for such a small device. Have The Motion+’s USB-C plugged into power along with using the speakers volume control not the source device when you’re seeking the loudest output. The longer I live with this speaker the more I appreciate it. It’s an attractive design that’s understated yet compelling. For example, the power button glows white while powered on and changes to a blinking red when the speaker is running out of juice. In this state it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged in to a charger via the USB-C port, the Motion+ increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch! I purchased a second Motion+ and my observations are that something magical happens with this speaker between the 3rd and 4th charging cycle. Keep that in mind when listening to yours. Critical listening should happen after the Motion+ is played for 30+ hours. In regards to Bluetooth connectivity, I highly recommend having a dedicated music source other than your phone. That awesome playlist playing from your phone while your phone is blowing up? It’ll be paused by the speaker from all the notifications.I modded mine, see photo, by super glueing a convex item over the bass up button, ensuring my speaker will always sound good! :-)The Soundcore Motion+ is a technical marvel of inspired engineering. I am consistently blown away by its performance. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019",AF67AQ42X5P3EYLUS6XXSDRTBORQ,True,166,Color: Black
R1CSRVU64OQJD8,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars You have questions, I have answers",TazandSteve,4,"This is going to be long winded, but I'll likely answer a lot of your questionsMy intended purpose was to replace an aging Bose SoundLink Mini 1 that I was using for music in my garage gym. The SoundLink mini is an impressive speaker when it's size is taken into account. They provide a deep, full sound and produce great bass, but struggle when turned up much past 60% (at least mine does, but it is old). What I wanted was a speaker that could get louder while still producing a quality sound. I found that in the Motion+.When I first unboxed it, I noticed that it is heavy and has a very solid build. It is, however, it's not beautiful. The rubberized outside feels good and feels like quality and there are two rubber feet on the bottom to keep it in place.When first powered up you are greeted with the power up and pairing tones. They are honestly less annoying than others I have heard, though I know of no way to disable them.Pairing was VERY fast and straightforward and I can get a good distance away (I didn't measure though) without hiccups.It comes out of the box with Bass Up mode enabled. Listen... Bass Up mode sucks. It honestly should be called Treble Down mode. Yes it increases the bass, but not as much as you can in the custom EQ.I played a few songs in Bass Up mode just to see what I heard and as stated above, did NOT like it. I then played with the provided EQ settings in the app. I think if you are going to choose a canned EQ setting from the Soundcore app, the ""heavy"" one is decent. After that I played with the ""custom"" EQ settings and the speaker really started to come to life.Once you settle on an EQ setting you like, the SPEAKER retains those settings. So even if you pair it with a different device it will still play with your EQ settings.Now, I also have a built in EQ on my OnePlus 6T and decided to try that. First I turned off the custom EQ settings on the speaker (best way to do that is to hit the BassUp button on the speaker twice. Once turns on the BassUp profile and a second one turns BassUp off, reverting to ""bassoff"" mode). My OnePlus EQ has some ""general enhancements"" setting that I applied and I played with the sliders and it sounded pretty awesome. Then, I applied my custom Soundcore app's EQ on top of that and WOW! One EQ was awesome and two were even better.My next major test will be to try the speaker from different sources. I have access to a couple Samsung S9s, some android tablets, etc. I don't own any iPhones so I can't test that out. I'll update my review after doing more testing.I played with it for a few hours yesterday and even played it a bit in my car on the way to work this morning. I did find that the sound actually seemed to change slightly after playing a while. I don't know if speaker break-in is real or not, but I believe that the bass has become fuller and warmer after a few hours use. I'll update on this aspect as well.I am eclectic when it comes to music so I'll give a quick rundown of the types I've tried and what I thought.- Country music: I played several Chris Stapleton songs and I felt this showcased the speaker the absolute best. All the instrumentation came through warm and clear.- Heavy Metal: This is a WIDE genre and will likely be what is most often played on this speaker (it's for my gym, remember?). I found that ""industrial metal"" (Rammstein, NIN, etc.) needed a little massaging in the EQ to separate sounds better, but sounded great afterward. I ended up leaving these minor adjustments in place because they helped all the other music too. Atreyu, FFDP, Volbeat, etc all sounded powerful, loud and full.- Rap: Honestly, on day one I was ready to say that this speaker just sucks for beat driven hip hop music. However, after playing with the settings and letting it ""break in"" (if that's a thing) I was wrong. For example, I recently played ""come and see me"" by Ludacris which relies heavily on a bass line that varries from low, to really low with some thumps thrown in. I could hear all the deep frequencies, the slightly higher bass tones, and the periodic thumps moved my speaker. After that I threw on UGK's ""Gravy"" which also relies heavily on bass and it sounded fantastic.Now, how about that bass, since that's why most of you are here. This speaker is able to play really low frequencies, but it will NOT ""hit you in your chest"". You will hear all the bass, but you wont feel the bass... why? Because it's a freaking portable bluetooth speaker, not your home theater system, your bookshelf system, or your car stereo. If you want to FEEL the bass in your chest or whatever, you'll need to pony up for a speaker with enough size to resonate those sound waves. Doing so, you'll likely lose a lot in portability and whatnot. However, I have heard that the ""w-king D8"" is a good bass head speaker. Check out some YouTube reviews (or just order it, it's super cheap).Another thing to note is that the high frequencies are capable of getting louder than the low frequencies. As you crank this up, the bass will reach a point where there just isn't enough room inside the enclosure. People say you ""lose bass"" as you increase volume, but you don't, you just stop increasing bass at a certain point while the treble keeps on going. I've ran mine at somewhere near 90% volume and I can tell you that the drivers are still increasing their work, because the speaker basically starts having as seizure. It's just that there isn't any more space inside to resonate the waves.The reason, and the ONLY reason this isn't getting a full five stars from me is that my speaker farts. Yes... you read that right but only when cranked to uncomfortable levels and bass heavy music. There are a couple possible reasons for this. I could be asking for the passive radiators to do too much (I have two EQs, after all). It could just be the way it's designed (although I have read a TON of reviews on here and Reddit and never seen anyone mention this). Or my unit is defective somehow. Think about that last one though. If I DO have a defective unit, and my review is still this good, what does that tell you?I will reach out to Anker/Soundcore support just to ask some questions because their support is amazing. I've had other products from them and they provide the absolute best support I've ever received.To end (for now), this speaker really should be an automatic buy if you are looking for a portable BT speaker with high end sound under $100. If you are looking for ""slap you in the lungs"" bass, get something LARGER. I don't care what brand it is you can't get more real bass out of a package this size... physics is physics.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHWVSZSTGXPDVPTOWARPP5H5QPQA,True,193,Color: Black
RNUN8GDHN4LUE,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars High-Res is a Gimmick. SBC only on Shield 2019 Pro. better raw than Sony SRS-XB32 though,SpeedingCheetah,4,"Don't fall for the label of ""High-Res Audio"" that many brands are putting on their speakers or headphones. At least Sony has grounds to say so kinda, as they support LDAC codec which is far better quality and resolution than even AptX.(LDAC 32bit/96kHz/990kbps vs AptX 16bit/48kHz/352kbps). And I don't think they mean High-Res for the AUX jack, as that audio is processed by the source DAC, not the speaker. This Anker does have AptX, but not the actual ""High-Res"" version AptX HD. (AptX has been around since BT early days btw. Since the very early 90's and AptX HD was out in 2009....and yet, u rarely see them on BT speakers despite their proven superior audio quality.I can get this speaker to connect to my Pixel 3 via AptX and it does sound surprisingly good for its size.It will only pair via SBC on my 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro. (SBC 16bit/44.1kHz/328kbps max)I tried a Sony SRS-XB32. That paired and used LDAC fine. However, it would have dropouts and pops every 30 sec or so.I have 2 sets of different Sony headphones, they use LDAC with no drop outs at all, but a Fiio BTR3 with LDAC that does cut out.I guess Shield is is picky.My main use for this speaker, is to replace a 10yr old Bose Soundlink 1 Bluetooth 2.0 speaker.I read this is a BT 5.0 speaker, and my 3 BT devices, the Shield, laptop and Pixel 3 are the same.I use this for my laptop(via Aux mostly) and recently my new Shield for late night TV watching when my large sound system is disruptive to my apartment neighbors or asleep roomates.Having 2 BT devices paired to this speaker at once(my laptop via BT and my Shield for example), when ever one devices makes a sound, the speaker will go silent for about 3 secs, then play the other source. It auto switching back to the other device it seems is harder for it as it pauses for much longer, 6 secs or so. Most of the time, i have to pause, or restart playback on the previous device to get sound to play. It is a little bit more gracefull when switching from the AUX source and the BT, but it still is a bit of a pause and fade in/out for a few secs. Best to mute or just disconnect the other source, to avoid your main source being interrupted constantly.The Bass Up default sound profile, is a tad muddy sounding, but had good sounding lows, for a speaker of this size. Turning it off, makes it sound too cheap and flat though. At least one can use the Smartphone app, (if you pair it to your phone) to use other profiles or a custom EQ. I am still playing with the EQ.Overall sound, i would say lacks some clarity and definition from the Bose Soundlink 1, but it has far better lows. Was hoping the ""tweeters"" this Anker has would be closest to the Bose, not quite it seems. (Bose does make very good products, but are overpriced. But i got the Soundlink speaker years ago at a Goodwill for $5...sooo....)Compare to the Sony SRS-XB32, which is a more expensive speaker, this Anker has better raw sound to me. Overall more clarity, definition, and more separation.Bass is tad deeper sounding up close, the Sony has a different design and seemed to output the deeper lows more front wise and could be heard better further away in that aspect. When using LDAC however, the Sony shines, despite the difference in no tweeters and different drivers. The Sony, however, only supports SBC and LDAC for some reason, so if i wanted to use my laptop via BT, it uses SBC. (The Sony also, if u have a AUX cable plugged in , it is locked to AUX mode, can't use BT unless you unplug cable...make it not usable for me.)Using the EQ in the Anker Sound core app, to make it more my taste, I really do like the sound this speaker produces, however, doing so, I can very much hear the poor quality and compression of SBC codec when playing music vids from my Emby Media Server from my Shield. Source audio files are FLAC or WAV. It really too bad this thing wont pair using AptX. Using my phone and AptX, it is much better sound. Laptop also will connect via AptX and sounds great too, but not as great as when using AUX of course, but, good enough that i may decide to ditch my Creative USB sound card that is eating up one of the 2 usb ports on the laptop.The USB C jack on this Anker is welcome, coming from a AC to DC adapter Barrel plug to charge.The top buttons are pretty much invisible on this thing. They blend in to much and are quite small, hard to find by feel alone as well.The power button on the side has a LED in it, so that is easy to find, but i would prefer power on the top along with the other buttons.Gotta give this speaker a bit more time to get adjusted to.It had a 15% off coupon sale when i purchased it here, so it makes it even more worth the lower cost than the Sony...but, it still is a disappointment for use as I mainly wanted with my Shield with AptX.EDIT: After a week of using this speaker, discovered some more quirks.The speaker does NOT remember the volume settings after you or it auto shuts off.This is especially annoying for use of AUX, as the volume is way to low and u have to press the Vol up button several times each time the speaker is powered up.The EQ you set in the app, does not function when using AUX.There is NO low battery notification at all. Only the power button LED blink red when u try to turn it on, then it turns off. No way to know the battery status while in use or at power up. (the Sony speaker had an option to announce battery level at each power on and, by default, had verbal battery low notifications on the speaker, several before it finally would die.) So unless you have this paired to a supported phone at all times and monitor via the app the battery charge, you have no idea on battery level. (those BT battery level in the phones OS is often very delayed and inaccurate in my experience with other battery powered BT devices)Battery life could be better for a speaker this size and weight. I have a much smaller Soundcore 2, and that is years old and lasts hours longer than this speaker. (Not a big deal for me, as I can just leave this speaker plugged into usb power from my hub most of the time.)","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020",AH7QQTSSML3TTGZK3PRZLC454YTA,True,54,Color: Black

R2XJD2H0R604QM,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars This speaker won, out of many - I LOVE this speaker",Michael C.,5,"As you can see from the attached pictures, I tested a good number of speakers. I was in search of a speaker around $100 or less that sounded good and would fit in a suitcase for airplane travel, and used indoors in hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins. I didn't closely check dimensions and mistakenly bought a few that turned out to be too large for that purpose. I was also targeting speakers with aux inputs and power bank capabilities so I would be able to use and simultaneously charge an aptX LL bluetooth receiver. This speaker didn't have the power bank functionality, but as it turns out, I don't need it (explained below).I have a choosy ear, and once equalized with the Soundcore app this Motion+ speaker sounded better at medium to low volumes than all of the others, including the Soundcore Motion Boom, and even the larger speakers you see in the pics. The sound out of the box was not great. The app's equalizer presets were not great either. I had to do a custom EQ to get the sound the way I liked it. The beauty with these Soundcore products is that the equalizer settings stay with the speaker. They are not specific to your phone. My only complaint with the app is that you cannot save multiple custom equalizer presets with the Motion+ like you can when using the app with the Motion Boom. Why the interfaces need to be different between the two speakers is beyond me.I do believe I noticed a difference with the aptX HD Audio. I could enable/disable that option in the phone's Bluetooth setting. With it on I can hear a little bit more fidelity. Of course, MP3s and streaming audio are not great sources for testing this sort of thing. I still heard a positive difference.HUGE BONUS (for me) that I didn't know about and don't see advertised anywhere on the product page. This thing supports aptX LL (low latency)! That must just come with the other Qualcomm aptX stuff. I use aptX LL to extend my whole home audio system to ""dumb"" speakers. I had purchased a tiny aptX LL receiver to plug into this speaker via the aux input, but now I don't need it!The Motion Boom was a close second, sounding better than the rest (once equalized) but losing to the Motion+ for my use case. The Motion Boom could get a little lower, and likely louder (not tested), but the Motion+ was punchier and had a better sounding low-end overall (once equalized). I'd say the Motion Boom is probably better for outdoor, high-volume listening. I already have a larger, less portable outdoor speaker that I'm happy with, so I returned the Motion Boom. I was disappointed that the Motion Boom didn't have an aux input, and I thought the soundstage was rather narrow with the treble changing pretty drastically as you walk past the front of the speaker. If I needed an outdoor speaker I'd definitely be trying out the Motion Boom Plus.I can't comment in detail on all of the other speakers I tried, but notable contenders were the Tribit XSound Mega which had surprising bass for its size, and the W-King X-10 which sounds pretty good loud but not so much at lower volumes. It's also rather large for a suitcase. The rest sounded like crap out of the box, to me, with little to no low end. Some had an app where I may have been able to make them sound better, but I did not try.I'm very happy with this speaker so far!","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2023",AHHFOMVDJROC4MMFD23LOD5KDMOA,True,44,Color: Black

R6RXRMP7F42X6,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars As of 7/22, the best $100 speaker on the market!",Joey Kot,5,"TL version:great sound with the companion app to balance the speakers EQ and take advantage of its balanced drivers.$100 is an absolute steal for the size (just short of the keys section of your keyboard) and sound with great dispersion, sound stage and bass impact [with the EQ tweeked]Excellent for a cheap sound bar solution as the voice clarity rivals my center channel speaker, absolutely shocking me tbh.First let me say i own an absurd amount of bluetooth speakers, everything from $20 pharmacy brands to the mega-sounding Aiwa Exos9. So when I saw anker get into the speaker game a few years back i figured it wouldn't be great - but not bad either. For the most part the soundcore line has been that, but has made considerable improvements over the years. some, like the soundcore 2 to 3 jump was not. the motion boom to motion boom +: Very much. I held off on the motion+ (this model) for a while and ended up getting it on prime day super cheap. While my wife wasn't happy to see another speaker sitting around... i sure am.Without seeming too full of myself, lets just say at 40 my hearing is well above that of a normal teenager let alone anyone my age. Because of this I've wedged my way into testing groups and other audio testing, my electrical engineering degree doesn't hurt either.. now on to the motion plus:its a unique size to be honest, its larger than what the price range would indicate, bigger than a bosemini for instance, smaller than an aiwa exos 3 but carries a price tag of $100-$120 USD which puts it into a questionable scenario based on suspicion alone. it has a weight that makes it feel well built, and a coating that to me says it doesnt. The coating is this rubberish coating that over time does wear out and become smooth (ala the soundcore 2 has), but its not a turn off. i don't expect an aluminum finish for these acoustics or price. The buttons are standard it seems on all soundcore speakers, up/down, bluetooth/tws, multi B button. this speaker also sports a Bass-UP button that i suggest you never use. it resets the EQ sound profiled to Bass-up and pressing the button again resets it to original. as features go, would be nice to see a scrolling EQ when this is pressed even if there is no visual aide to indicate where youre at. nitpicking folks, at its finest! Sound wise this thing shines. its frequency range is top to bottom for anyone to hear, and the soundstage disperses sound in leveled sweet spots from about 3 feet on a desk, about 12 feet out you start to loose the distinction but not the sound. this is above average for this sided speaker and i found myself using it more in situations where a smaller speaker wouldn't work. During my tests battery life was on par to what is listed as 12 hours, although like with all speakers the type and level of listening matters. I'm tempted to buy another and line them up next to my mid-sized go to pick, Aiwa's Exos 3... even though that device is larger slightly theres considerable comparisons. what might set the motion+ apart is its forward firing sub driver and open air port in the back, which puzzles me as to how it has a reflex port in the rear AND an ipx7 rating. you can bet im going to take this apart soon to find out... just as soon as i take a break from enjoying the sound of this thing during work. final conclusion is pretty straight forward, the negatives are few with the battery life being maybe, maybe a stretch the only down fall of this speaker. simply put, you will not find a speaker at one hundred dollars to replicate this sound. period. probably ever.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2022",AEU4QM6M252IYJLVIARY3YHJ3KHA,True,28,Color: Black

R104NRVAJCWY4K,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive and Good Sound,DG,5,"I use this for computer and play from tablet while working. This is not a name brand like Bose, Bowers or Sonos. I have those as well. But a better value. The reasons are below after using for a while.1. Unlike others the multiple drivers produce stereo sound. The expensive brands BT speakers will tell you that it doesn't matter when two speakers are in close proximity. But if you are on a desk where the speaker is located, you will hear the clear difference a stereo speaker makes. You do not need to take the hassle of pairing in TWS fashion.2. Produces clean sound. I am not an audiophile but have decent ears being a former musician. Even the newer products from the company are falling for market gimmicks to attract customers. This is a slightly older model but still better. May be you get BT 5.0 instead of 5.3. I could care less.3. You can adjust the sound profile through the app.For the things I didn't like -- the USB and Aux input had a heavy rubberized cover that was unpleasant to move for charging and input. It is there for weather protection I get that. I cut it off to keep the ports open. It stays on my desk, not shower. A minor thing and not a product fault.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGDUMDFJA76JQFTYJFTTCTDE7MZA,True,1,Color: Black

RICMATGLW44ZR,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beats the Doss Soundbox XL Hands Down, Freaking Awesome Sound",Handy,4,"Update: 8-24-19I have now had this thing for a bit over a week and I can truly say that this is the bestportable speaker I have ever had. Battery life is awesome and music is great. Thanks Anker.Sooo, a couple of weeks ago I purchased the Doss Soundbox XL. I had been checking out reviews andI really thought that it would be the speaker for me. I was really excited to get it in my hands.But like finding out your Facebook date looks nothing like the pictures, it was a huge let down.I knew after the first 3 songs that it was nothing like I thought it would be. Very muddy sound,and super small sound window. It was like having a blanket thrown over it.After trying everything I could to fix it, I finally sent it back.As soon as I got the refund I ordered this, the Anker Soundcore Motion+, and waited impatientlyfor it to arrive and have now had it for a bit over 8 hours.I remember when I opened the Doss I was really surprised at how big it was, almost awkward.This was not the case with this speaker. Very nice package and a good weight to it.This thing is simplicity in it's self. Buttons are easy to find, just a momentary push on the powerbutton turns it on and into pairing mode. It starts in ""base up"" mode which was fine for me.Played my first song. Big smile, oh yea. Clear highs, very tight base that was clear and robust.Very nice sound stage. So I did the same thing as I did with the Doss, I took it all over the houseto hear how it sounds. Corners make this thing come alive. It truly is where this speaker wants to live.One thing I learned was that this speaker comes with the ability to play aptx and that Android8.0 or above has this option. This is a Bluetooth tech that allows the music to sound as much likeCD quality as possible using Bluetooth. Bluetooth data has to be compressed to send to the speakerand usually that causes sound quality issues. But this tech aims to fix this and seems to really work well.I then took this speaker with me to a building I'm working on and it's empty right now. It's a big100' x 100' building. It has a few small 8"" corners along the front of the building and I made that it'shome. Kicked up some tunes and got to work. All I can say is this thing simply blows me away in it'sability to project good sound even in such a large empty area. Of course, once I started using equipmentit cannot compete but dang. I would walk out and back into the building and it just sounded awesome.So, now for the only thing I don't like, and the only reason I gave it four stars.The app. Now the app it's self is not really the issue at all. It's the privacy agreementand all the things they make you allow to use it. It's off the charts. If you care anythingat all about your privacy then this app is a no go. And this is where things get ugly.See, you cannot update the firmware without the app. So in order to update the speakersfirmware, I have to accept some very ugly privacy conditions that I simply cannot agree to.Sadly, most people don't even read these anymore. They just click and play. No thought aboutall the stuff that is being sent to Anker in the background. And not just Anker, but all their affiliates.This is like a huge spiderweb of companies that we know nothing about.To get past this, I just installed it and then after getting the update, I just uninstalled it.It's weird, some of their speakers can be upgraded on your pc, but this one cannot.So Anker, please if you read any of these reviews, fix this so we can at least update the speakeron our computers at home without having to accept and agree to terms we don't like. Honestly,I should not have to allow you to have all that information just to use a equalizer and updater.So besides that one issue, this thing rocks like no tomorrow on virtually anything I played on it.And will be my go to portable speaker for as long as the thing will play.Thanks again to Oluv's Gadgets for reviewing this great speaker, I should have trusted your judgementin the first place.Enjoy : )","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2019",AH5V4FGFB6RGWQGFJZAK5MGAHZUQ,True,31,Color: Black
R2Z4G7YU22UY5E,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Not good for stereo but decent for the price in a small speaker.,JD and MD,4,"Full disclosure: I am a musician and recording professional, so I may be a bit more critical or discerning than the average consumer. That said, I hope this review will help anyone else on a similar quest. I was on the search for a pair of bluetooth speakers to connect in stereo for use in our yard or home. I purchased 2 JBL Xtreme (first edition) at $150 a piece, so $300 for the pair. I had issues with connectivity and could only use them if they were within 5 feet of each other. The sound was decent and plenty loud, but too hyped up in the bass. They made a lot of songs sound muffled or too boomy. The JBL app has no options for EQ so you’re basically stuck with what you get if you want to use multiple devices to connect.I then looked around and found some great reviews on these Motion+ speakers and liked the price point, plus the fact that I could use a custom EQ. They also use bluetooth 5.0 so I thought it would be better for connectivity. So I ordered 2. Turns out stereo connectivity was only better by about a foot or two! Same issue as the JBLs! Dang. I guess that’s just what you get when pairing multiple speakers. I live in Portland, OR, so we are not rural, but our yard is a half acre and I didn’t think I’d have this much of a problem with interference. Funny how speaker manufacturers all advertise up to 30 feet, but have a disclaimer about it depending on other mysterious factors. Like living in city?The custom EQ was nice for the motion plus speakers, but with some caveats. First off, you are starting with a sound that is so boxy and mid focused, I just wonder what the heck they were thinking. With the default EQ setting, these were absolutely horrible sounding. By cutting some mids, I was able to get a decent sound (posted a picture of my settings) but still a bit boxy. The problem is, in stereo mode, only the master speaker changes with the EQ. This led to a lot of fiddling with connecting and disconnecting the individual speakers to try to get each one EQ’d the same as the other. After tons of back and forth I was able to get them sounding decent. I found cutting mids reduced the volume output, but sounded better than boosting low and high frequencies.The real problems came about when the Bluetooth connection started get really strange. Volume fluctuations and skipping like a cd that’s scratched. I had to leave my phone right next to the speaker to resolve the issue, but at about 10 or 15 feet away with no obstructions, there was definitely issues. I returned these after that, as the whole point was to have music filling up our large back yard with a decent sound, but have the phone on my person to be able to DJ tracks.I went to best buy today to try out some other options. I figured one bigger speaker would be a better solution at this point. The Ultimate Ears Hyperboom won...by a mile. That speaker is amazing sounding. Not sure why Amazon doesn’t sell these new, but for $399 that speaker kills the competition. My search is over. I just ordered one direct from UE.I feel bad for buying and returning speakers but hopefully this review will help someone else who is looking for the best sound for indoor and outdoor use. The bose pro system also sounded great but at $600 it wasn’t much better than the UE hyperboom....and with no 360 sound, I’d need two and I am definitely not willing to part with $1200 at this point and I want a more portable option as well.Good luck all you music lovers, and I highly recommend that JBL and Anker/Soundcore look into making something that will compete with UE’s Hyperboom. That speaker kills the JBL Boombox...and the JBL partybox lineup just sounds loud. No balanced sound, just loud. Sony’s lineup also sounded decent but a little lacking comparatively. If you’re like me, and like to hear/feel the sub frequencies, the Hyperboom is a clear winner. JBL boombox is next in line, but my wife hated the look of it.Long review here, but I saw there is a shortage of detailed and technical reviews for what I was looking to get, which is a big sound in an indoor/outdoor portable bluetooth speaker, for a reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020",AEZZMXVRUJAWYFY72SGSWECFPY6A,True,6,Color: Black
R1EB8M1E8RTIXU,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Probably the Best Speaker for this Price Range,imyourpal,5,"I put this up for comparison vs my first generation JBL Xtreme and also the first generation Bose Soundlink Mini. Keep in mind that the Soundlink Mini is a smaller speaker and isn't necessarily in the same league, but price wise it is.Volume - JBL Xtreme takes it, Soundcore Motion+ comes in close second, Bose Soundlink Mini hard thirdSound quality - Both the JBL Xtreme and Bose Soundlink Mini had a clear emphasis on bass, to the point where unless you used a third-party equalizer it could get pretty muddy at times. Neither distorted at high volumes, but the DSP definitely showed it's limits. For a party, you might not really care, but for focused listening you'll notice it for sure. I believe that the Xtreme, while rated at 40W output, only gives 20W when played unplugged, but I could be wrong. Soundlink Mini has no wattage output as Bose generally doesn't provide that. Soundcore Motion+ has both speakers beat here - it's got a relatively flat DSP, and the app does have an equalizer that you can customize. Whether plugged in or not, it supposedly outputs it's full 30W. There's clear stereo separation on this speaker as well, and I think (but am not sure) that the JBL Xtreme has two tweeters as well. For this I'd go Soundcore Motion+ first, JBL Xtreme second, and Bose Soundlink Mini third.Size/Portability - JBL Xtreme is the largest but comes with straps, Soundcore Motion+ is second with no case/straps, and SoundLink Mini is smallest with optional cases. The Motion+ is actually pretty easy to transport in my gym bag and I definitely don't notice it there as much as the Xtreme. I'd go with the Motion+ for best overall portability.Inputs - All three speakers have bluetooth/AUX inputs, and the Xtreme takes it one step further with USB inputs. by sheer number of options, JBL Xtreme is first, followed by the Soundcore Motion+ as it has BT 5.0/USB C, and Soundlink Mini last.Weather-Proofing - JBL Xtreme and Soundcore are more or less tied here (waterproof/resistant, dust proof/resistant, have sealed flaps for the ports) while the Soundlink is meant for dry/temperate use only.Battery Life - Considering I've owned the Xtreme and the Soundlink Mini since they came out, their batteries have definitely deteriorated so they don't get the same amount of hours they used to get. I'd say that the Xtreme at it's peak gave me about 8 hours and the Soundlink about 6-8 as well. Motion+ is rated for 12 hours and I've been getting about 10-12 hours. Motion+ first, Xtreme second, Soundlink third.Charging - Both the Xtreme and Soundlink have their own proprietary chargers which can be incredibly inconvenient. Motion+ charges via USB-C and can be charged with some higher powered portable battery packs as well as wall warts, which make it the clear winner. The Xtreme does have the added benefit of providing power through it's USB ports which is handy in a pinch. You could attach something like the Moto Stream and run it off the Xtreme's battery while playing via AUX to have a better party speaker which is kinda neat. Motion+ first, Xtreme and Soundlink tied, with the Xtreme having a slight edge on being able to power other devices as well.App Support - Bonus or negative depending on your view. Bose doesn't have an app for it's first generation speaker so it's not considered. JBL's app is relatively simple, but doesn't provide any EQ for it's Xtreme. You can link another speaker to it, so long as it's supported by it's proprietary Connect... connection (note it does NOT work with Connect+ speakers, so you can't connect the Xtreme to the Xtreme2 which is a bummer). Soundcore app is simple as well, but includes a customizable EQ and allows for your speakers to connect to other Soundcore speakers. Overall I'd give it to the Soundcore Motion+ for it's customizable EQ.To me the contest is clearly between the Xtreme and the Motion+; the Soundlink just doesn't compare despite being priced similarly. I'd say the best overall speaker around this price range is definitely the Motion+ - it covers all of it's bases nicely and can match the Xtreme in enough categories while sounding better. If you can get this speaker for sub $90, then you got yourself a deal!","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2019",AGIWDIAYZVC6JN52X4JMH3VXRUFA,True,5,Color: Black

R5YJ9IGH1AFCZ,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Love it but has annoying cons,Jon Rodriguez,4,"I bought this speaker after my tribit 20 to 30 dollar speakers died so I'll compare the anker with the tribit speaker.The anker is significantly louder, bigger and heavier. It has a led on the power button that is white when it's on or red when it is low on battery power. When you turn it on. It plays the usual anker jingle when powered on and off if you own any of their earbuds and headphones.What I like: it gets loud and it's clear. The bass is not feel it in your chest but it's pretty good better than the tribit for sure. I like the buttons on top, they are big and easy to press. The overall materials and heft to it just gives the impression of durability and good build quality. I also like how thick and big the rubber protector is on the usb c and output connectors section. Of course it's a usb c charging format.The middle of the road things:My tribit speaker lasted about 24 hours before needing to charge but would take 8 hours or more to charge. This one lasts for about 12 hours (haven't really tested it but seems about right plus or minus). However it takes usually 2 to 4 hours to charge back up so take note of that. It's not plug and play (I'll get into that in cons). Power button is smaller than the tribit and located on the side and not as easy to press.What I don't like:The bass button and feature is doodoo. It basically is there to make the default settings better which it does. However the default sound settings are horrible. This is not, I repeat not open up the box charge and play. You really need the soundcore app for this bad boy. It's vital that you go into the app and use the equalizer to make it sound good. Don't use the preset modes they are pretty bad too. there is an issue with that too. If you own any earbuds or headphones there are options to have multiple eq profiles(that you created) that you can switch between. This has 1 so you cannot switch between profiles depending on what your listening to which is perplexing to say the least. The other thing I don't like is the price.my tribit cost me 20 to 30 bucks. This shouldn't cost 100 bucks or 90 bucks at all. This should cost 60 to 75 bucks max regular price. It's louder yes but it really doesn't improve battery life, it's not plug and play and I don't care much about setting it up but just 1 eq profile? Really?In conclusion is it good? Yes. Does it have stupid cons? Yes is it worth full price hell no? Should you buy it? Hell yea but only if on sale not full price.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AFSWTPDGR57E567Y5GSOJKRQUN3Q,True,10,Color: Black

R2G3VQW1K8ST8H,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Quality changes with complex music,AA,4,"Just like ALL devices with speakers, all the tests and YT reviewers all use SIMPLE audio to perform so-called tests… Providing the devices with the least stress possible.This particular device, actually does the best for its size with simple audio, HOWEVER with complex music such as Classical music or Metal, all the smaller devices completely fall apart. Why? The 2cent answer is because a piece of complex music requires reproduction of almost the entire frequency spectrum at the same time (think ALL the instruments at the same time), so that when a speaker’s suspension is moving to reproduce bass frequencies, it ALSO has to reproduce audio from a smaller wave at the center of the speaker… sound waves then crash into each other all over the place and this is called DISTORTION…The question is, does this one? At lower volumes, this SoundCore motion+ actually does very well, but this IS NOT for blasting, in fact I still have yet to come across another product of this size that does this well.As far as accuracy of sound, again, at low volumes it’s fantastic… at mid volumes it still outperforms everything in its size and price…If you like LOUD Complex music, there is NOTHING in this size that will do the trick.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AEAN6TP6HQOIMBQELTJBK6ISXJWQ,True,0,Color: Black

If I can't hear it or feel it, I'm left feeling empty. Especially at a lower volume setting. And, that's where the Oontz 3 disappointed me. Not so much with my new Anker Soundcore Motion Plus.I know, I know... it's not even really fair to compare the two because they shouldn't be in the same ring, throwing punches at each other. All I'm saying, is that if you want a bigger punch, with all of the flair included, I suggest the Anker option.Bear in mind however, that if you decide on the Motion +, you will surrender a round or two on the scoring card of ""portability"". Anker's Motion + is heavier and much larger. It still fits into my bookbag and laptop carrier okay, but there is a noticeable difference when trying to make room for it, and especially when lugging the bags around.With all this being said?

Keep in mind that every firmware update can affect the sound quality.I honestly wasn't that impressed with this speaker out of the box. I got it dialed in much better by using the EQ in the Soundcore app but there are still some frequencies that are overboosted that I can't tune out with the EQ and since I am using an IOS device Apple doesn't give me anything that will work with Amazon Music.Out out of the box I'd give it a 5/10 for its size. Dialed in I'd say closer to 8/10. I bought the EarFun Bluetooth Speaker UBOOM L at the same time. Basically, no EQ options for it as it doesn't have an app. You can choose sound modes which are for indoor or outdoor which seems to accentuate or attenuate the bass a bit. Out of the box this speaker sounded far better than the Motion+. Even with the Motion+ dialed in the best I could with the EQ the Uboom sounds better. I'd give it an 8.5 or 9/10. The best I've tried in this size group has to be the JBL Charge 5 WiFi.It costs twice as much as the Motion+ or Uboom but I caught it on sale and it was very close in price to the Motion+. It also has the best battery life of the 3.The Motion+ is a good option. The bass lacks compared to the other 2 I've mentioned but mids and highs are pretty good but there is a sort of a peak around 5k that makes it a bit shrill. The other 2 seem to extend better into the bass area.I'd give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly one of the best in this size group. I'd put it a #3 cost no object. I'd put it at #2 if cost is an object. The Uboom is #2 for best sound independent of price and #1 if cost is a significant driver. Best sound is JBL Charge 5 WiFi by a nose so #1 here. I'd put it #3 if cost is very important. If you can catch it on sale, It would be a tough decision between it and the Uboom.","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AGIWD5JTRA54MGAL4GGQ34HWTIMA,True,2,Color: Black

When the bass boost is enabled, the bass is just about perfect (it's pretty underwhelming without the boost). I keep it plugged into power most of the time, so I can't speak to battery life. Bluetooth pairing was a little awkward with my laptop for some reason, but that's probably because I didn't read the manual.Is it worth the current price ($100)? If you're looking for something portable with great sound, definitely!

R33VIU0WU1MBEU,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent, But Revision/Firmware Differences Limit Functionality",DMA,5,"I originally purchased this Soundcore Motion+ more than a year ago, and once I customized the EQ via the Soundcore app, I was super impressed with the sound quality. I never would have expected such (comparatively) impressive bass in conjunction with crisp, non-shrill highs from such a small enclosure. It has been a joy to use.After reading of how terrific these speakers sound when joined in pairs for the full left/right stereo effect, I purchased another from Amazon yesterday. Alas, after going through the pairing directions multiple times, I had no success in pairing the two speakers.In my research to find out the cause of the problem, I followed Anker's posted instructions on how to reset the speakers, delete the pairings from my phone, etc., but no luck. I then happened upon a post in Anker Community forum where the person had two speakers with two *different* firmware revisions, and they submitted a ticket to Anker to find out if the pairing should still work. Anker responded that: *no, in fact it won't*. When I doubled-checked my speakers, my older speaker (FCC ID ending in A3116) had a firmware revision of 45.xx, while the new one (FCC ID ending in A3116J) has a revision of 75.xx, so that is my issue. It is unclear if Anker would be able to update my older speaker's firmware at some point to match the new one, or if hardware enhancements might prevent this. Presently, though, I am unable to make use of stereo pairing of the two speakers, which is the entire reason I purchased the second Motion+.*Edit: I reached out to Anker support with this question, and they promptly responded that, yes, this is the case: the two versions actually contain different chipsets, and they will NOT pair with one another.****Edit: I originally knocked off one star for this issue, but I have now added it back, as I purchased another of the newer version speakers, and it pairs effortlessly with its twin. I will gift the older version to someone, since I don't need three units. They all sound wonderful, though.I would prefer that Anker make some distinction as to the different revisions of this product and perhaps add a disclaimer about the pairing issue between different versions. If not Anker, then perhaps Amazon could take the initiative and edit the item description. Should potentional buyers want to be able to take advantage of the stereo pairing feature, particularly if they already have a Motion+, I would recommend buying them in pairs to maximize the chances of getting the same hardware revision and firmware.Overall though, it's a fantastic little speaker with wonderful sound quality and sufficient battery life for my needs, and I would highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AFEKQJBJSQZUOG54HQF6B7DBYZBQ,True,24,Color: Black
R2GH4AQZKUBPPH,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, can't be beaten. One of my favorites.",David Bryan,5,"I am a totally addicted to Bluetooth speakers and to quality sound. For the most part, you get what you pay for when you buy speakers. In the attached picture, you will see a lot of speakers. There are pros and cons to each one and each one serves a purpose. Here is some of what I've found on each one:Aiwa Exos 9 - This is a great speaker for a party or for camping. It is 200 watts and has an equalizer so that you can get the sound just like you want it. It is very loud, but will distort when you turn it all the way up. It is too large and usually unpractical for most situations.Harmon Kardon Go Play 2 - I like this speaker for indoor use. It is 100 watts and has some deep low end sound. It is heavy and pretty large. The main thing I don't like is that the battery won't last more than about 2 hours when you listen to it at a decent volume.Logitech Boombox - I have two of these and they were my go to speaker for about 5-6 years. The sound is very close to the Anker Soundcore Motion+, but these are quite a bit bigger. Also, I think the Anker Soundcore+ sounds a little better due to the equalizer on the Soundcore.JBL Xtreme (version 1) - This is currently one of my favorite speakers. I use it for listening to music on the beach or around the pool. It has more pronounced bass than the Xtreme 2. It sounds great and has no distortion at full volume and it gets loud. The Anker actually gets very close to as loud, but the Xtreme maintains its bass at it's highest volume and the Anker loses some of it's thump at full volume.Anker Soundcore Motion+ - This is also one on my favorite speakers. I love both the equalize and the volume. It does not distort at full volume, but does lose some bass. It sounds much larger than it's size which means you get a very portable loud speaker with great sound. I am so impressed with how much power this smaller speaker delivers. It is very versatile and will work for almost any occasion.Bose Soundlink Mini II - This speaker is amazing for its size. It is great at lower volumes for listening at home or around a pool. It's portability is hard to beat and it puts out amazing bass for its size. It just doesn't shine when you turn it up as it loses almost all of it's bass when you go past 60-70 percent volume.JBL Flip (version 1) - At one time, this speaker was considered amazing. It is loud for it's size. These days, I'm sure the newer versions are much better when it comes to sound quality. I use this speaker for white noise when I am staying at a hotel or on vacation.Overall, my new favorite speakers are the JBL Xtreme and the Anker Soundcore Motion+. They are both amazing and the JBL is slightly more powerful. The Anker's size, weight, equalizer and power make it more portable/convenient for most listening situations. In all of my years of buying speakers (and I own a lot more than just the ones in this pic), I haven't found a better value for the money. Even if you don't get it at the discounted price, it is huge bargain. If you're on the fence, go for it. You won't regret it!","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020",AGHOTCVPOKO5LDKFW4HTNXZUM7IQ,True,3,Color: Black

R56I69OFW1W11,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Hail ! The New Junior Welterweight Champ!!!,Gerald S. Brady,5,"I know a lot about and own several Bluetooth speakers. I own I think the largest ""party speaker"" that Anker makes the Rave, which is a very excellent product. I also own a W-King, also a very excellent product. I was using my W-King on my nightstand about 2 feet from my head. I had acquired a desire to upgrade the W-King with something perhaps more elegant and smaller and less utility looking. Eureka! I happened upon this heavenly creature of a Bluetooth speaker. The W-King currently costing $75 dollars is still the best bang for $75. If You are not so poor that you can't squeeze another $25 dollars out of your wallet, I very strongly suggest that you pull those rubber bands from around you wallet, let those moths escape and kerplunk down $100 and buy this box instead. I used my W-King as a reference point in my quest to hopefully replace it. The Motion+ is half the size of the W-King and sexy. It has the build quality and appearance of an Apple product ( Dr. Dre. Pill on illegal steroids.) Hold on to your hat ....... although smaller, this thing plays louder and clearer than the W-King, I mean actually. If I had not myself purchased this and blindfold tested this, I would swear that I was hearing a Bose Wave CD player. I had considered buying a second Motion+ but decided not to. Unless you have to realize the added dimension of stereo you'd be make something that sounds really good, sound really good and loud. I don't need that in my life. A second one of these would be a waste of money as you would always be listening to the two at a low volume setting. (Two of these could work out for you if you throw parties. Your guests would be wondering where is he hiding his towers and subwoofer ?) Thank You Anker !!!! This is a revision to my prior review. I previously stated that owning two of these would be a waste of money. At this time I would like to retract that statement as nonsense. I took the plunge and bought a second Motion+. My position on the matter now is that two of these make something that sounds good, sound better (probably something to do with increased power bandwidth using two). I have these installed on either side of my headboard. I sleep literally bathed in hi-fi. I sometimes sit on the other side of the room astounded that that sound is coming from those tiny drivers and passive radiators, (A coup de gras for Anker research & development and engineering.) However I should point out as some other reviewers have there. is a problem sometimes with bluetooth connectivity. I choose to call this phenomenon ""line of sight radio wave interference"". If you learn to live with this system, the problem will loom as minuscule. Also some reviewers have complained about the sound quality. I could only imagine that these people do not or don't know how to use the included Soundcore equalizer. ( With this, and any audio system a graphic equalizer is essential to optimize performance and sound quality.) Using Anker's or any good equalizer app plugin I can find nothing wrong with the sound of this box. ( What doe's anyone require from a box that's 9.5 by 3 inches and cost one hundred dollars and has a battery and is portable, and fits in your pocket if you wear a big coat ???!!!). Thank you Anker.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2020",AHC5KODBOLAH3V62W4MMUSNOH74A,True,2,Color: Black

RT179HSU7O04H,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Competition to more expensive brands,Basilisk,5,"I was actually looking to buying similarly sized JBL speaker in my local shop.Luckily, done my research before doing that.JBL - no aux, very basic BT format SBC, rudimentary app, well extended and slightly uneven FR, sounds ok in person besides weird grain somewhere in highs, around 10Hz better bass extension. Price is 3X.Motion Plus - AptX HD and low latency mode, aux in, which I use a lot, can be connected to both my and my gf phones at the same time, 9 band EQ, a bit smaller than JBL, fits my hand well, wide sound dispersion, ok and easy to EQ stock sound and all that while being 70-80 bucks. No brainer.Sound.Sine sweeps by ear subjectively correlate with dips and peaks in RTings measurement from 400Hz and up.Some of FR unevenness can be addressed by EQ in Anker's app, though 4-6 band parametric EQ will solve all the major issues.EQ preset on my screenshot is made on the base of BassUP preset to make the stock FR closer to flat.Removes shouty peak at around 3KHz, zingy peak at approx. 5KHz, fills in some lower treble and air.Values in Db differ from what may appear reasonable by RTings graph - they're adjusted accordingly to my subjective perception during sine sweep runs (for instance, I pushed 2.5KHz down lower, then it ""supposed"" to be accordingly to graph).You can easily adjust value in Db to flatten FR accordingly to RTings graph.Stereo mode.It exists, it works and it is very easy to setup, which is awesome. I wasn't testing it thoroughly, but in my case there is a delay in starting the playback, so first couple of seconds of song are omitted.Since stock frequency response is still very decent, app is great and price is low, motion plus makes a great gift.

R2IIVN3WSFIFI,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Soundcore Motion+ vs JBL,Tammy W.,5,"I have to say, as far as bluetooth speakers go, I've always been a big JBL fan. I've had a JBL Xtreme, Flip 3, Flip 4, Clip 2 and Clip 3. Recently my Flip 4 battery began to die so I started researching replacements. My natural inclination was to get a Flip 5, which I did order from Amazon and eventually used for a comparison with the Motion+. I watched a bunch of You Tube video comparisons each proclaiming how good the Motion+ is. I also read a ton of comments on Amazon so I decided to order it. This thing is unbelievable for a $100 speaker! I have to say I was a bit skeptical, but it really lives up to all the positive ratings and comments. Based on the sound comparison with a Flip 5 (which may or may not really be fair), it blew the Flip 5 away. Probably a JBL Charge 4 or 5 would be a more fair comparison, but I don't have one so I can only speak to what I could actually compare. What I noticed: 1) Clarity - incredible clarity even at high volumes. At around 75-80%, JBL began to lose some clarity. Motion+ was still clear as a bell. 2) Stereo! JBL doesn't to my knowledge have any true stereo speakers. Motion+ actually plays in stereo (yea!) 3) Amazing bass for its size. It's not going to give you the same level of bass as, say, a Bose S1 Pro (which I also have), but you can't expect that it will. However, for its size, the bass is punchy, deep and clear. Make sure to use the bass boost function. 4) There's an equalizer app available for Android or iPhone. What a nice feature! 5) Other nice features: IPX7 water resistant and rugged shell - just like JBL. If you're looking for new speaker or even your first one - definitely at least give the Motion+ a try.UPDATE: I recently got my hands on a Bose Soundlink Color II and did a sound comparison. The Motion+ blew the Bose out of the water. I'm always tempted to try something new and see if it beats the Motion+, but so far nothing near this price can compare.Another comparison: I tried the Motion+ against the new Bose Soundlink Flex. While the actual sound of the Bose was superior and had some nice punchy bass, the Motion+ was louder and still held its own to the Bose. Morion+ wins it for outdoor use for sheer volume. I do think the Bose Flex wins for sound clarity and smoothness and would probably be better for indoor use.Update 7/23/2024: I just ordered another Soundcore Motion+ to pair two of them together. I'm very disappointed that you cannot pair on older version Motion+ with the new version. Soundcore: please fix this! In the meantime, I'm sending the new one back. My old one is still going strong after 3 years!","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2021",AH6EWYO4Q4Y5DBPVIUT2NWNQZKOQ,True,9,Color: Black

While that is perfectly acceptable for listening to podcasts indoors, the sound quality is lacking for music. And it's not loud enough to use outdoors without significant distortion. In the last year I've shifted back towards more music listening, and needed a speaker upgrade. There are a ton of options, and you could spend a lot more money if you wanted the absolute best sound quality. The reviews for the Soundcore Motion+ were generally good to very good, so I took a chance because I've had a great track record with Anker products. The other options I considered were the JBL Flip 6, JBL Charge 5, Ultimate Ears Boom 3, and Bose SoundLink Flex. I'm listing these for reference to the price range, quality, and size I was looking at before purchasing the Soundcore Motion+.Pros:-Overall excellent sound quality. I have never been one to buy the best quality speakers, but this sounds significantly better than the small speakers I've gathered over the years and probably better than my Subaru Crosstrek Sport 2021. It is not as good as my old school Aiwa and Sharp 3-piece stereo boomboxes, but it's pretty close. For reference I mostly listen to metal and rap, and I judge sound quality on how my favorite metal bands sound on different speakers.-The form factor is rock solid and sits flat. It's going to be more stable than other options that are more cylindrical and especially the speakers that sit upright.-Directional speakers over the wraparound style. I want a speaker that directs sound towards me and doesn't fill the room, especially at work.-Battery life is excellent. It is listed as 12 hours but I think it's quite a bit more. Technology websites have tested it being closer to 16 hours.-USB-C charging and Aux ports. These days it's hard to find Aux ports on speakers. If you have an old iPod like me then it's nice to have that Aux option.Cons:-Heavy and bulky compared to other options in this price range. I have no problem grabbing the Soundcore 2 to move it around the house or between labs and offices at work, but the weight of this makes me think twice about casually grabbing it.-Charging is slow, longer than I'm used to with the Soundcore 2 and other small electronic devices.-Minor quibble, I wish all of the buttons are a little bigger.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2023",AEWIZKAI3H4NTZISXLY4U3HUFH4A,True,11,Color: Red

Reding,4,"My nearly 20 year old Bose Sounddock finally died and I was looking for replacement with good sound and small size. The Anker Soundcore Motion Plus has been a great replacement. I believe the sound is equal to my old Bose. I had purchased a small Soundcore 2 several years ago for use on my patio and travel and was very impressed with the sound. This Soundcore Motion Plus has an even more solid bass and clear treble and is a perfect size for our small living room. The bass boost is solid and with 30W of power should fill most spaces with thundering volume. Two devices can be linked for a true stereo effect, but for a small room the sound experience with a single unit is excellent The device is water and splash resistant for outdoor use, but gives piece of mind for use in my living room where spills from cats and grandkids are possible or if I wanted to take it to the kitchen. It would also be perfect for use at your cabin or on your deck or patio. The exterior does have a rubber like coating, but comes in several colors that look fine for your indoor spaces.There are a couple of small issues. Because it is battery powered you will have to physically turn it on to use it. Battery life is quite long, but It will turn off automatically when not in use with an auto shut off feature that can be adjusted via a phone or tablet app. It would have been ideal to have it turn on via the phone app or through an Alexa voice app. The manual that ships with the device is useless pictograms. Fortunately I was able to find a written owners manual online and one is available with the phone app. The equalizer on the phone app only allows you to turn the bass boost on or off. It would have been nice to have actual equalizer controls over a range of frequencies or preset equalizations for music or room type. However both my Android phone and an Alexa app have equalizer features. Aside from the pictogram quick guide set up was easy and the Bluetooth sync was without problems for both my phone and Alexa. The app also allows for firmware updates, but also includes push notifications. The device also supports the latest Bluetooth codex, though your connected devices may not offer that higher standard e.g. generation 1 and 2 Alexa devices. The speaker can however be directly connected with aux line in with an included cable.Overall the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus was exactly what I was looking for and at the price I wanted to pay. Given my good experience with my Anker Soundcore 2 speaker I would expect this product to be equally trouble free.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2022",AF6SON7PE54ISGTP7IWKTUBIFLXQ,True,1,Color: Black

I did a blind sound comparison between my new Apple HomePod and my Soundcore Motion+…with my wife, a couple of buddies, and myself. They both excell at different things- (highs, mids, lows)…but the overall SQ between the Motion+ and HomePod was pretty much a toss up. Also convenience wise, the Motion+ beats the Apple on several fronts (and I have an iPhone LOL). Keep in mind the the HomePod is $300 and the Motion+ is $100. Im liking the Motion+ so much that I ordered another one and paired them together. I tried to do this on my own but couldn’t quite figure it out. I called customer service and a rep answered my call right away, was very professional and walked me through it. As much as I enjoyed the 1 speaker, having 2 of them synced together sounds VERY VERY VERY nice! I enjoy this set up so much that I decided to return my Apple HomePod. I have nothing negative to say about this Soundcore Motion Plus! Get it, get the app, and if you have $200 to buy 2 of them…DO IT. You’ll be quite blown away with the SQ for $200. If you don’t have the cash for two, one Motion+ is plenty good for most people. Again, I’m a bit of one of those “sound maniacs” or audiophiles. I’ll just throw one more thing in- the build quality on these guys are SOLID! I’m a very happy customer. 👍🏻 I buy a lot of shizzle on Amazon.

Back then, the battery life was acceptable, but I don't think it was ever near 12hours like advertised. Maybe half that, maybe a bit less. Not a biggie. However, in my attempts to have one bluetooth device for each PC / phone that played audio to avoid the struggles of trying to determine which device was taking over which bluetooth device, I started using this again.Battery life now is about non-existent. I don't have exact figures, but I expect it's easily within an hour it dies if not plugged in when in use. I basically have to leave it plugged in, which works for its use case, but not ideal. I have a lot of Anker products in my shopping history here going back almost 10 years. A large number of those products are in use today still. Possibly I got a dud here. It's a solid bluetooth speaker, and while I'd usually go with Anker over other brands in a number of categories, certainly against others in the same price range, I'm not sure I'd get this particular speaker again, as good as it sounds.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AFRFJ3MRUMG3NAYTSCTHSIBBI75Q,True,1,Color: Black

R321LM3M3OT3WY,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars I returned my equivalent Bose speakers for these and never looked back,Kalel-510,5,"Sound quality and volume are excellent in these portable, wireless, Bluetooth-connected Anker speakers. Very little distortion at higher levels. I had a few connectivity issues until I got the hang of it, but everything is jake now.I had a pair of the equivalent ($99) Bose wireless portable speakers and returned them for these.Anker vs. Bose comparison:* Sound is superior in Anker speaker. Bose does offer the choice of mono or stereo sound.* App needed to pair Bose speakers. No app needed to pair Anker speakers.* Once Anker speakers are paired, they stay paired when you turn the speakers on again. No need to re-pair as with Bose.* Anker has an equalizer function to customize music. Stays at the setting when turned on again.* When the Anker speakers are paired, when you turn one off the other shuts off as well. Bose speakers must be shut off individually.* When music is paused, the Anker speakers stayed powered up for much longer than the Bose speakers, roughly 20 vs. 5 minutes. With the Bose I always felt that if I left the room for a couple of minutes, I had to open the app again and re-pair the speakers.One item to note--when I first got the Anker speakers some songs started half a second into the song intro, a semi-annoying problem I once had with a pair of earbuds. However, that issue seems to have resolved itself.The sound between the Anker speakers will ""drift"" from time to time. That is, sound will fade in one of the speakers and increase in the other for a second or two before equalizing again. Happens occasionally and is not annoying enough to put me off the speakers.I would have preferred a vertical rather than a horizontal orientation, but the Anker speakers are very solid and portable. I love to move them around the room so that no matter where I am, I am perfectly between the two speakers.There's something about the speakers that make the music very comfortable, almost soothing, to the ears. I I never want to turn them off.I had a pair of the equivalent Bose speakers and returned them for these. A friend of mine did the exact opposite, but that's because she wanted the mono sound option in the Bose. Some people think it's better for parties because no matter where you are in relation to the speaker, you can hear all the instruments in the song.I am very happy to give these Anker speakers two enthusiastic thumbs up.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2021",AGDE2OJXVZ4B2UV6ZYUH5JKLVCJQ,True,2,Color: Black
R29GO5GDCXQAHN,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal Sound for the price,Ajani Grant,5,"After some faithful years my JBL Charge 3 has fizzeled out. Resorting to being on the charger to work. Reddit actually led me to find this speaker.Pros:Budget. As it was on Sale for $85 versus a charge 5 at roughly ~160, and everything else far above thatSound( with tweaking). The audio out this thing is amazing. Not life changing. Not ridiculous. But as someone who primarily listens to hip-hop, jazz, and r&b, this speaker in it's 6-8 hours of usage already has blown me away. It gets loud. It has crisp bass, decent mids, and pretty clear highs. For the price range this is what I've come to expect and it has matched expectationsPairing. By holding Bluetooth you can pair two of these speakers together and this naturally offers double the amazing sound and you can truly fill a bedroom with music. I'd compare the experience to having a massive soundbar (like an entire walls length) with a mini subwoofer. It's actually an incredibly immersive experience. And once again, the price of this thing means buying two might not hurt your bank terriblyVolume. Even with a singular speaker I can easily fill my bedroom with more than enough sound. In a masterbedroom, half the room is drowned with music and the other is conversation level.Cons:Battery. The battery at 75-100% volume will die at roughly 4-6 hours. I've had two sessions on one battery session right out the box before resorting to charge. That's not terrible to be honest but worth mentioning as a conMax Volume Sound. You are going to sacrifice some quality of sound as you increase volume pass 75-80%. I don't notice distortions, but the bass actually gets outpowered by mids and highs which slap out, for lack of better terms. I do find this problem remedied with pairing two speakers and having them on opposite ends of the roomOverall:I look forward to seeing how long this speaker lasts me. First impressions are strong. I am happy for now. The battery is a minor con for the overall quality of the products sound. Make sure to download the Soundcore application and check reviews for your personal custom tweaking. This is completely unpaid just decided to write because Anker has never disappointed in my household.Easy 8-9/10 product.

R3I3FJYPNV3J1Z,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great overall value. Loved it so much I added another!,Bryan A,5,"I've owned a number of Bluetooth speakers in my life and my complaint is usually the same on anything that doesn't include a high price tag. Most are muffled, lack clarity, and are particularly bad on the low end. I've read the countless reviews on the Soundcore Motion+ and finally decided to try it out. I'm very glad I did as it's by far the best smaller Bluetooth speaker for the price or less that myself or friends have enjoyed.Pros:-Sound quality is very good for what I listen to and I listen to a lot of genres of music, movies/shows, and racing.- I love the size and weight of it. It's built very well. (It might be a bit too large/heavy if you like small ultra light weight speakers)- Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent, the app works great, I really like the stock EQ settings as well as the custom EQ.- Value compared to the well known name brands is exceptional.- I love the rubber on the top and bottom of the speaker. On slippery surfaces it grips well and on the top it's a nice soft touch. The top does show fingerprints, but those are really easy to clean off. I prefer that to just plastic or cloth by far.- I've not had it out in the direct rain, but I've had it out in very high humidity conditions and have spilled water on it and it didn't affect it at all. It just made it easier to clean.- The 15 degree angle of the speaker is awesome if you're sitting down or standing up. It definitely makes a difference if you have it lower than ear level listening.Cons:-I wish it had a mute button-I wish it had a battery life indicatorNeither con is enough to deduct a star from it though. You can obviously mute it from your device or see the battery life in the app, but when I'm full screen watching something live it would be nice to easily see battery life or mute on the device itself, especially when I have it hooked up to my mini PC. On a phone or tablet that is in your hand or right next to you then it's not a big deal at all.Overall this speaker is flat out awesome. I'm very happy with my purchases and I look forward to seeing what Soundcore can come out with in the future. A larger version of this with some more low end bass would be the best of all worlds in my opinion! I just wish I wouldn't have overlooked it for so long, because it wasn't a big name speaker brand. At this price and above it's the real deal!","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2021",AEY5Y4O7TLRCCHI2DHNE6YTJXBLA,True,7,Color: Black
R1XARHZH2G2SE6,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING for electronic music,Kyle Archer,5,"A disclaimer: I use this speaker with Android and use only FLAC audio files which means I'm taking full advantage of the AptX Bluetooth codec. If your phone doesn't support AptX (like an iPhone) I wouldn't recommend the Motion +. Find something that supports AAC instead.Ok, so I'll be honest. I don't care for this speaker for rock music. That's my big criticism. The rock I listen to is heavily layered and drenched in distortion and reverb. Think ""wall of guitars"" style. In other words the sound is huge and occupies the whole spectrum as a sort of singular mass of sound. My Galaxy Buds + handle this perfectly but The Motion + seems to have a hard time and the sound is unbalanced, like the speaker is trying to emphasize a certain frequency that doesn't make sense for this music. Random frequencies of guitar distortion are elevated and it sounds really off, even after playing with the EQ setting.However for anything electronic I've found this speaker sounds absolutely stunning and it seems to me that's what the Motion + is geared for. The clarity is unreal, especially for a Bluetooth connection. I listen to everything from heavy bass EDM to rich, ethereal ambient music. With the bass heavy EQ there is a massive bass presence but it remains a refined, tight sound instead of a muddy boom like many other Bluetooth speakers. The mids retain clarity and punch despite the bass and the treble is clear as glass. All in all the sound is incredibly high quality and perfectly balanced but again, just for electronic music in my experience. This doesn't bother me too much because this is primarily what I listen to but many people aren't into electronic so I thought I'd state this for fans of rock and metal. Another thing to mention is the overall presence of the music. I can flip this speaker around to face the wall and it still somehow fills the room with crystal clear sound. The battery life is very long, charging happens pretty quick, and the aethetic of this speaker is just as appealing as everything else.To recap: If you're an Android user and you love electronic music just buy this thing. You'll be blown away. For everyone else though I'd say there are much better options out there.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2022",AF33Y2RIQHKDYOUV2QAUIFIZZYTA,True,3,Color: Black
R31ZMRWYQKIQ64,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud and Clear,Mark,5,"My old 12 watt Anker Soundcore was too quiet for some audio books. I drive endless hours over the highways delivering your food to distribution centers. Headsets are seen by the DOT at the pre-clearance sites with those big cameras looking right inside the cab of the truck. Also even the bone induction headsets cause an achy soreness after a few hours so a Bluetooth speaker is essential for listening when the truck radio's Bluetooth auxiliary is bad. This new 30 watt Soundcore+ is plenty loud even when climbing up a 6% grade with 40,000 pounds cargo and the huge engine is screaming and the giant fan is blasting like a turboprop at takeoff. I mistakenly bought an Oontz unit with 24 watts and it does not connect easily nor provide adequate clarity or volume, the Anker Soundcore connects effortlessly. Easy automatic reconnect even after my audio book is interrupted by a phone call. I've left the speaker on all night while I sleep and there's plenty of juice left for NPR news with coffee at 4 AM without plugging in the USB. I really truly benefited from the ""table"" of products I found on Amazon for the Anker Soundcore speakers. With that I found the perfect unit for my truck. My old 12 watt unit lasted about 4 years blasting it's little heart out for me before it ruptured a diaphragm. I was so sad it blew up so when I found the table of Anker Soundcore speakers I grabbed-up my 30 watt unit because I trust the brand. I couldn't be happier with it. You might think that speech in an audio book would not need quality sound, but the high-res digital audio reproduces excellent clarity at any volume I need. Quality sound is important for audio books so you catch every nuance and inflection of the voice actor. I bought it specially for the truck and I just love it's audio quality, substantial physical weight and higher volume capacity, battery life is over the top, and I know it will withstand the high vibration and moisture environment and keep blasting away because it's little brother did. I will probably replace my big screen TV at home just so I can get a mega-blaster that rattles the deck plates from Soundcore !","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2022",AGHVEHQZT44AEEQ4PVHQV6LYOY3Q,True,0,Color: Black
R3HKYV5DWFVH6P,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible value!,da_musicman,5,"I own an original Bose Soundlink, a Bose Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition and the Soundcore Motion+. The Motion+ is far and away the best value of the three. It’s midrange beat the pants off both Bose speakers. Without side by side comparison, I think most people would be happy with a any of these speakers but when compared side to side, my preference is definitely for the Motion+. It's the only one with a remote that has a graphic equalizer. That’s huge! The ability to fine tune the sound to your individual hearing gives it a gigantic edge. It sounds clean and full with decent bass (not overly exaggerated) and excellent midrange and highs. It has good build quality and is also waterproof. It can also be paired to a second Motion+ for a wider stereo soundstage. (The new Bose models also have this capability. There is a microphone for using it as a Bluetooth speaker phone if that floats your boat. It has a battery life rated at 12 hours though I haven’t had it long enough to deplete the initial charge. The Soundlink Mini 2 has a similar battery rating and I have to say is an engineering marvel. Though not perfect, the sounds that comes out of that tiny thing is nothing less than amazing. I think the original Bose Soundlink has the best soundstage of the three, followed by the Mini. The soundstage on the Motion+ is decent but not quite as good as its competitors. However, I think the overall sound quality of the Motion+ across the frequency spectrum is definitely the best. Highs (electric guitar) on the Mini can be somewhat strident and sounds much more smooth and natural on the Soundcore Motion+. The Soundcore just seems to have a much fuller sound with nothing or very little missing. (Keep in mind that these are all small portable Bluetooth speakers not high end studio monitors driven by great amplifiers so they all have limitations!) When switching to the Soundlink Mini 2, it sounds like something is missing. Oh, did I mention that the price of the Soundcore is only 100 bucks?! The Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition is $150 at Costco. That’s 50% more and doesn’t sound as good to me. The original Soundlink sold for $300 if my memory serves me correctly. If size is a driving factor, then the Bose Mini 2 is worth exploring. However, if you can put up with a little larger but still relatively small speaker, in my opinion you will not find a better sounding speaker than the Soundcore Motion+ in the $100-$200 price range. It’s a solid buy. Anker did a great job with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2021",AG7CABQBZF37LILPWYLUJ2OA5OEQ,True,1,Color: Black
RRGX14M3T4XYQ,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive sound, Bluetooth is weird",Aaron Reitz,5,"I got this to make computer audio audible when playing videos outside with my small group. For the price, the sound is pretty impressive, with decent bass and no obvious peaks. I think the output is mono, even though the speaker contains two drivers -- not a big deal on a small speaker meant to be listened to from a distance. It feels very solid and heavy in the hand and the body has a soft-touch coating on the plastic, giving a nice feel. (Note, though, that I've seen these coatings degrade into a gooey mess on other products, though I haven't had any issues so far on the Motion+.)My main gripe is with the way the speaker handles audio connectivity.First, when using it with a computer, I generally want to use the wired connection for audio rather than Bluetooth. However, the Motion+ defaults to trying to connect via Bluetooth every time you start it up, and sometimes it is difficult to figure out how to make it fall back to the wired connection. There is something flakey about its detection that the audio cable is plugged in.Second, I don't know if this is a problem with the Motion+ or with Bluetooth in general, but I've seen some weird behavior when multiple devices have been configured to connect with the speaker. Sometimes I'd have it connected with a computer one foot away by Bluetooth when suddenly the audio would cut out and I'd start hearing some other audio playing. It turns out that the speaker was switching to playing from my mother-in-law's iPad, that must have been 20-30 feet away at the time. It is maddening to me that another device could just cut in on an existing Bluetooth connection like this. It seems like a major security flaw. Strangely, I've also seen my phone try to play audio to the speaker even when I am miles away at the time, as if the phone can't tell that the speaker isn't present. Due to these issues, sometimes I have to just tell my devices to forget the speaker. It's really frustrating.Still, I don't run into these issues often enough to make the speaker unusable, and maybe I need to apply a firmware update or something. I'd still recommend the product for it's high-quality audio for the price.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AGW5PEVKSAHGE34IPTUWCPWNDZJQ,True,2,Color: Black
R2ODBY2ZJQ8B9T,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sounding speaker,Dave,5,"I bought this speaker primarily to use outdoors on my deck and patio areas. I researched reviews for bluetooth speakers under $100 from several reliable audio and tech websites; then watched YouTube demos. I narrowed my choices to Anker, Tribit, JBL and Oontz. I chose the Anker Soundcore Motion + for it's driver configuration (full range drivers with separate tweeters, passive radiator and bass port), 30-watt power and size. The ability to customize the sound with the Soundcore app was also a deciding factor.When I received the speaker, I was pleased with the build quality. Initial set-up was a snap, took less than a minute. I downloaded the Soundcore app and reviewed it's features and available options.Now, for the audition. Let me preface by saying, I am a guitar player. I listen to real music, played by real musicians, playing real instruments. I do NOT listen to computer-generated, sampled, auto-tuned disposable crap (no offense to those that do; everyone should listen to what they dig). I began with Fleetwood Mac's self-titled album from 1975 in ultra-HD on Amazon music. It's impeccably produced and has a great drum mix (a true test for any speaker) I scrolled through the pre-sets on the Soundcore app for the first track and dialed in my custom EQ on the available equalizer. I turned up the volume and stood back about 12 feet from the speaker. My jaw dropped. I could not believe the sound coming from this portable little speaker. Great full-range audio from lows to highs. Mick's drum were punchy and deep. Much better bass response than I anticipated (though I did need to dial it in with the EQ). Wonderful separation of instruments, crystal-clear vocals. The soundstage was surprisingly wide with good depth for a single speaker configuration (non stereo setup). I was impressed (and I am not easily). I mainly listen to vinyl or CD on vintage, audiophile quality equipment (I also stream in ultra HD with a quality DAC). The Soundcore Motion + far exceeded my expectations.Are there bluetooth speakers out there that are better, or louder or have more bass? Yes, of course. But not for $80.

R1OF459KAAYVO8,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Awesome speaker; appallingly short Bluetooth range.,No,3,"I’ve had this speaker for a little over a year now. In almost all respects, I have been very impressed. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth range (or lack thereof) is a serious flaw.The good:The sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker. I never would have expected such a rich bass from a speaker this size.The Soundcore app allows me to customize the EQ for my tastes. This allows me get the most out of the small speaker without washing out the overall sound with pure volume.Charging, portability, and durability are all right where they should be. Again, very impressed by the quality.The bad:The Bluetooth range is appallingly limited. I have connected the speaker to multiple iPhones. Most of my Bluetooth devices can maintain a solid connection well over 20 yards, especially if the devices are within line-of-sight. This speaker, however, will start to drop a Bluetooth connection in less than 5 yards, even without obstacles in the way.It is a serious flaw. There is no point in having a Bluetooth connection if the phone needs to be that close to the speaker. I might as well buy a 3.5mm cable and just hardwire the connection.If you want to use the speaker during a backyard cookout, that’s fine. But you’ll have to leave your phone sitting right next to the speaker instead of in your pocket as you walk around.Again, it’s a great speaker, but the short Bluetooth range is a serious flaw.____UPDATE after another 6 months:*When connected to the charger, it may not be able to draw enough power to function at higher volumes. I used it at a party recently, and I had to keep the volume at maximum (or close to it). The battery died after about 3 hours; no surprise there. I hooked up the charging cable and turned it back on. Every 10 to 15 minutes it would die again. I'm assuming that, at full volume, it uses more power than it can draw through the charging cable. This is very disappointing. This is the only time I have used it on max volume for extended times and the only time I have used it hardwired to the charger. But it should be able to draw power consistently enough to function.For what it's worth, even at the high volumes the sound quality was still impressive. The bass was a little lacking, but it's still impressive.*The bluetooth range is still appalling. It's also inconsistent. I actually got it to connect at around 20 yards the other day. But it would randomly crackle out or drop the connection. Again, I eventually just placed my phone right next to the speaker.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AFYI4JVG2NYFLOBVED2TLERIPIAA,True,6,Color: Black
RGV7Y77KCH4HF,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Physics cannot be cheated; the hype is unfounded,Frank Doghearty,4,"(08/10/2020) After several months of satisfactory performance, I am raising my rating from 3 to 4.(Original review:) In order to be fair, I used the wired connection for this review. (The speakerphone feature works well, which alone is making this a keeper for me.)The tiny drivers simply cannot produce anything close to a pair of 30-year-old Sony amplified speakers with 3"" drivers. In fact, the sound resembles the tiny USB speakers that came out 15-20 years ago, possibly because that's where its sound comes from: tiny speakers. Of course, for the price, you do get some privileges: namely, bass-reflex design and silk domes, both of which far surpassing the potentials of cheap, tiny computer speakers.Some reviewers did note that using the app would give away ""your voice"" for free, so that is obviously not an option for those who care for that sort of thing. Without the utility that enables various equalizer settings (out of which the basic setting should have been built in to begin with), the device falls flat, exhibiting all the shortcomings that its tiny drivers entail (the uncompressed sound coming from an iPad 3, using music and movies from Amazon Prime). Severely colored sound, bad to the point that even mp3 sound just as ""good"" (or shall I say, bad) as uncompressed sound. Some people compared the sound to a DOSS Soundbox SL, but the latter actually reflects the difference between mp3 and uncompressed sound to the point that mp3 comes through severely distorted, because that's just the way mp3 sounds like. Of course, that makes this unit a winner for listening to mp3. For the Soundbox SL, that's a punishment for producing untainted sound (of course, there are better speakers out there, but they also cost more; I got my SL for $56 at the manufacturer's site and got $30 off this one, which I still find a bit much for the actual performance, although I am sure that two of these would be much better than a single unit and these can be paired for stereo sound, as opposed to the current Soundbox SL).NOTICE that my DOS Soundbox stopped working properly after about 10 uses, but is out of warranty, and this one is working fine!The bells and whistles, silk domes for the treble and a passive membrane for the ""bass"" do contribute, although only the treble is fairly improved, because such tiny drivers simply cannot defeat physics. Realistically speaking, ""bass"" starts over 100Hz, and any tweaking simply upsets the sound image and the sound balance.The price is paid for1. Outstanding battery life2. Being somewhat waterproof (I would not venture to experiment with that, but splashproofness seems reasonably true)3. Sophisticated design with extra ""bass"" (that is not really bass)4. Silk domes5. The option to pair two of these for stereo sound6. Excellent BT performance7. There is some stereo imaging, if you are using this below a matchingly small screen.However, if you are looking for a steady sound image without loudness and detailed, dynamic sound, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2019",AHXUNV656OFRHCTBGKYFCYS6UEHQ,True,13,Color: Black

In fact, I never felt the need to have this above 40% volume and this just sounds great.It was annoying at first since it randomly increased the volume during audio playback & when changing or restarting tracks but after unpairing from my devices and resetting the speaker, it seems to have solved the issue.I would have preferred physical buttons for previous and next track instead of the useless ""Bass up"" button since the feature can be enabled in the app. You'd need the app for firmware updates and sound customization and other settings, like auto off when not in use which you can set to your preferred time.The power button is a bit stiff and it's an arm workout to turn on this speaker. It also just dies abruptly without any sound notification when using the aux cable (not sure if its thw same with Bluetooth) and takes over 4 hours to fully recharge.You'd want to enable ""Bass up"" or Custom but with a flat profile because it sounds exactly like Bass up.

Seems to do well enough across the gamut but I like it best for lower volume bass heavy instrumental music that I listen to while doing other tasks.I've tried to use other bluetooth speakers I have that have aux ports for my PC (bose home speaker 300 in particular). In comparison: - This sounds as good or better to me, bose has a special warmth to it that this lacks but this seems more accurate and punches with just as much bass for a small speaker array. - This is portable/has a battery that the bose doesn't - The bose thinks I'm talking to alexa all the time and does weird things that this doesn't - The bose requires me to turn it back to ""Aux"" mode every time i sit down at my computer, not sure why - The bose doesn't have a mcirophone in it, this does and seems to work wellMinor complaints for my use case: - Super short cords USB-C and aux cords - going to have to fix that - The port cover on the side is a little annoying to have to leave open to get to the power/aux ports - It doesn't do bluetooth and aux sound at the same time while playing from your phone. This is more minor annoyance because some apps play silent sound constantly when they are in the foreground which mutes computer sound even though nothing is playing. More an issue with ios/those apps, but it's annoying when you get on a conference call and can't figure out why you can't hear people. You can have a phone connected that's not playing any sound and play the computer audio without issue though. This is workable.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2021",AFKRAKA427IIGNL7TTGEHL3K3XJA,True,1,Color: Black

I think it was maybe my friend David.Anyway, without opening his mouth, he spoke deep into my soul. A rumbling, almost tectonic voice:""DO YOU FEEL COMPLETE?""I could not speak, only a slight shake of my head once I understood that my answer was no.""DO YOU FEEL THE VOID, THE MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE?""I nodded, more assertively this time, without hesitation.""I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT, IF YOU ARE READY.""This time I spoke. A raw, unfettered vocalisation from deep within me. I could see my words taking the form of light, twisting this way and that, on their journey toward the dark figure. ""Yes. I feel ready. Please make me whole, I am ready. I am ready.""A pause which felt like a lifetime ended as the figure (still probably David) began taking in a huge breath. He took in more and more, as if preparing for a war cry. I could barely contain myself. I shook in my place, my gaze transfixed. I had totally surrendered to whatever might happen now. My soul was his.As soon as he started to speak, so began a sort of time-lapse of my whole life up to that point, like a flick book of all the important moments in my life. It brought me to tears. I wept joyous, rapturous tears as his voice, now even more seismic, finally told me what I'd been waiting so long to hear:""SOUNDCORE MOTION+ WITH USB-C CHARGING, 6,700mAh BATTERY, 12-HOUR PLAYTIME, 40kHz SILK DOME TWEETERS WITH ACTIVE CROSSOVER, CUSTOMIZABLE EQ, BLUETOOTH 5.0, AND IPX7 WATERPROOFING""I woke with a jolt, fresh tears in my eyes and adrenaline coursing through my body.

RR9AVJHGRHE0W,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply fantastic,GB,5,"I expected this to sound pretty good, based on reviews from various places...certainly better than the less-expensive bluetooth speakers I've had. I'm a lifelong musician...been around music of all types most of my life. I am blown away by the fidelity of this speaker. My musical tastes are all over the map. Everything is game, and this speaker handles it all impressively. From Coltrane to the Stones, and everything between.Out of the box, the frequency response is flat. That is by design, to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want. To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app, where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you. There are several presets in the app, but the real difference-maker is in the ""custom"" setting, which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with. If I had to describe this speaker's performance in one word, that word would be ""balanced"". If you're into bass-dominant listening (rap/hip-hop), you'll probably be better served by one of the boom-box models. This speaker offers rich, full and natural sound across the frequency spectrum, with plenty of volume as well.Punches well above its weight class. I'll grab another one when they're on sale again to have in other areas of the house. Highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AFAPKGR2EPFYDEZHRBDJRU2BYBNA,True,6,Color: Black
R2P7QEIOOGPNOR,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Buy it.,P,5,"As many other reviews have stated this is an almost perfect, and to some perfect, bluetooth speaker. I waited a few weeks before leaving a review to be sure, but I love it. The sound quality is excellent, as many others have stated this thing gets LOUD. Use the custom EQ for the best sound (I'm a rap fan so as a bass heavy genre it handles it perfectly!) Noticed minor clipping on certain songs (""Top Back"" by T.I. for anyone who knows it as an example) just go down one notch from max and it's good. Definitely plan on buying a second to link together and my ONLY gripe is that it won't accept more lol. It CAN play while charging if not charging from a fully dead battery, it will cut off until it reaches a certain level. Haven't played it constantly so I can't speak to the total battery life just yet, however, I've used it intermittently for a couple hours for an entire week and it lasted with no problems so I imagine a full day at the beach would be fine. The update solved the issues in the comments on the EQ saving and mine saved right out the box. Outside of that, it's done everything I needed and more, can't wait until we can get back out and I can use it for it's intended purpose! Stop reading reviews. I read over 400 on various competing products and watched hours of YouTube videos so I got you on the research lol this is the one.Update: 12/21/21: I've owned this speaker for about 2 years now so I have a full understanding of it's quirks and features and everything in between. My original statement still stands..... BUY IT. I have since bought another and saw someone else mention they are running more than 2 so please share how because I would have one in every room of the house if I could. These have been everywhere. Thrown in the back of the truck on beach day and plays LOUD the entire day. When we hit the beach it's from 10-5 and they last the entire time. I have received so many compliments from other people on the quality of sound from such a small speaker and the speakers themselves have been all in sand, had water on them and continue running without a hiccup. Someone mentioned it being ""invisible to bluetooth"" not sure what they were doing but I can hook these up to anything (and have)... Phones, my laptop, my surface, my TV, everything. I've been checking for an updated version but honestly if it's not broke then don't fix it and these just work perfectly.

RLNPR7VGAQIP3,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars WHOA! Yes, it's all that!",G. Curran,5,"I have an older Altec Lansing BT speaker. It's small, I've had it for a few years, it works pretty well for what it is. I probably paid $60 for it when I got it.I wanted something better, with more bass, better sounds. I don't need multiple speaker set up, or anything like that. I'm a musician, well, keyboard player, and my standard of reference is a pair of KRK Rokit RP-5s. They are very nice, low end monitoring speakers and I drive them from a high end D/A converter. The sound, for me, at 64 years of age, is all that I need.The Soundcore Motion + blew me away with it's sound. I would say that it rivals the RP-5s in clarity and sound discrimination. I did a lot of 'research' on new BT speaker, meaning I watches some YouTube videos, and the Soundcore Motion + always seemed to come out near the top of the pack. I can see why.If you want clear, crisp highs, a wonderful midrange and bass that is clear and accurate (I'm not talking window rattling bass, but bass that sounds like acoustic bass should), then this really is the speaker for you.The free downloadable app for your phone gives you custom EQ capabilities, plus there's an aux in for laptops and such that may not use BT.I am truly impressed by this. I'm also further impressed that by an additional $10 shipping cost, I ordered at 11 a.m. and had the unit here at 6 p.m. The only thing that would have made it any better was if it had gotten here 30 minutes sooner, since I was going out to a party, and it would have worked wonders there.So, if you're on the fence about this speaker, spend the $105 for it. I haven't listened to the Bose or the Sony or the JBL speakers, all of which are probably good speakers, but in the $100 range, I don't think you're going to do too much better than this speaker!

R152BTEUFK4UBY,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars *****************PLEASE READ UPDATED REVIEW*******************,BBB,5,"Read the reviews so I took the plunge. I wanted to like it a lot but the sound quality left too much to be desire for my taste. Even with the app, which allows you to make various adjustments, I could never really fine-tune to my liking. We sent it back and purchased our second Beats Pill +. To each his own.-----------------------------------------------------UPDATE BELOW-------------------------------------------------First The Good: Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker delivers excellent sound for the money on a variety of music genres. But I will say that in my specific case I did need to use the EQ, available as an app download, to get my sound to a level that would make this beautiful looking speaker shine. Now about that app,-Once the Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker is charged you will want to set up the previously mentioned custom EQ. To do that you’ll have to download the app. To use the Ankers Soundcore App, it does seem to want a lot of feedback which I’m sure is for future product enhancements. The decision is yours to use it or not. I had no problem.The longer we have used the speaker the more we enjoy the fun that comes with it. From its portable design, sturdy and solid craftsmanship, it’s built to last. One thing I enjoy is the power button glows white while powered and changes to a blinking red when the battery is low. In this mode, it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged into a charger via the USB-C port, Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch!I was able to get all of my eclectic music to sound very fine-tuned. I especially loved how I could Bluetooth to my TV and have my own personal speaker as to not disturb the neighbors on those late nights.My one issue is that at higher volumes it did tend to distort and I could not find a fix but with many EQ settings at my disposal we were able to come to a happy experience and satisfied with the sound.This is a solid speaker with the potential to sit alongside the BEATS PILL+(which I own) UE BOOMBOX(which I own)and in my opinion, is much better than the Bose SoundLink Mini II Bluetooth Speaker. (which I own)Lastly, the speaker gets 4 stars for quality and price but because Anker is invested in providing outstanding products and customer service then my all-around score is a solid 5.Great Fathers Day gift people.

But they did NOT ask me to edit or change my review. This is all my own doing (just a heads up).Initially, I had purchased this product due to all the stellar reviews from various audio reviewers. Item arrives and there is a terrible static, almost like a grounding wire was knocked loose, I'm not sure. Imagine turning on a CRT tv in the middle of the night at full volume with no signal. I had used the motion+ in a different system, different set-up, even had some friends of mine try a hand at it just to make sure it wasnt me.But it happens, there's bound to be a dud every so often. I returned the unit for a replacement. And that replacement, same exact thing. Same steps to troubleshoot but at that point, I was done with the product. I do have more anker products than I can count, they make some great hardware, but the motion+ in particular I figured I was done with. Let other people enjoy it, not worth the headache.I left an earlier review expressing as much and sure enough, a customer rep from Anker actually reached out to me. I like most people have grown very cynical when it comes to dealing with companies standing by their products and actually honoring their warranties BUT the entire experience has more than made up for the earlier issues. I'm still waiting on the replacement to arrive but until then, 5/5 at least for the customer service experience, and that's saying a lot these days.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AHHH34PFU33JE5K5W5SPHHUD5IWA,True,2,Color: Black

It's a solid performer, has punchy bass, and you can tune the EQ to your heart's content via the app. The speaker has heft, thanks to the 12-hour battery life. It feels like a quality product. It also has USB-C charging, which is a must in 2023.If I were to nit about anything, if you hold the speaker up to your ear, you can hear a distinct hiss when nothing's playing.

Calvert,5,"I've had a lot of Bluetooth speakers: Sony, JBL, Creative, Logitech, UE, Bose.....but I have to say I have become a true soundcore fan. Besides this speaker, I also have the Motion Boom and the Motion Boom Plus. They all sound phenomenal. In my opinion, Soundcore gives you the most bang for your buck. The Motion + has become one of my favorite speakers, so much so that I just ordered this one so I could hook them up in stereo. Unfortunately when I got this speaker I couldn't get them to connect even though I followed the instructions. I was informed by Soundcore that this was because my previous model had an older chip and firmware and they were not compatible. I was prepared to send this one back but the Soundcore rep went above and beyond to help by letting me trade my older version for a new one. WOW! Great customer service. I am certainly a Soundcore fan for life now. I'm a retired audiophile. I've had a lot of expensive stereo equipment in the past with outboard dacs and the whole nine yards. You're not gonna get audiophile quality in a Bluetooth speaker, especially one for a $100 or less. However, what you will get in this speaker is a lot of quality sound for the price. It's definitely worthy of the near 5 star rating. It's a very well rounded speaker with excellent highs, good mids and more than adequate bass. The app is user friendly and helpful in tailoring the sound to your liking. You can add another for stereo and the customer service is, what can I say, excellent.

Also my husband keeps turning off the connection in the app and if he even touches his phone, even having turned off the connection, it automatically overrides my own Bluetooth connection while I'm in the middle of playing a song. He unpaired permanently and hopefully this will be fixed. But there's the problem of my laptop. I'll be sure to unpair that permanently too. Never pair this thing with more than one device. It blows, because I need to use it with my laptop and my phone for original music projects I'm working on. The app doesn't do anything to help. Bluetooth just needs to die. However, I've not run into this with my little JBL speaker. It will not allow anyone to connect to it when it's currently paired with something else.Of course, my stupid phone has no mini jack output so I can't give up on Bluetooth altogether.Previous reviewI got this as a portable speaker to bring to music composition lessons. I'm composing music on the computer (hobby only) and it was hard to hear the lowest frequency instruments (cello, contrabass so far) on my JBL clip speaker. This isn't as good as studio monitor speakers, but so much more portable. And there's an equalizer in the app.I work on music in a casual hobby band too, and this will be much easier for me to hear the instruments, particularly the bass, in tracks they send me.I usually use very large, high-quality speakers for music listening but don't consider myself an audiophile. This is a Bluetooth speaker that's intended to be a portable convenience and has enough bass that you can hear the bass line loud and clear. The sound overall is crisp and pleasing. If I want the best, I'm not going to get that from a speaker I can put in a tote bag.

R30CETOJIZVBRA,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent speaker that could use some design updates,Nick Cunningham,4,"This is probably your best option at this price point in the ""large but still somewhat packable speaker"" market. The speaker is slightly larger than a 20 oz. soda bottle laid flat, but much heavier; you could pack this in a suitcase but it's probably going to take up too much room in a carry on or backpack unless you aren't bringing much else. It'll probably do fine in a bag to take to the beach or a cookout. It produces enough clear sound to fill large rooms easily and sounds good with the bass boost activated (and not great without it).I'm docking one star because in an effort to be sleek (and waterproof), Anker sacrificed some ease of use with the button layout. As you can see in the picture above, there are five buttons on the top of the speaker. In short, the buttons are confusing, mushy, and easily show wear.Two of the buttons you are likely using most often, the volume buttons, are the 2nd and 5th buttons in the layout. If you aren't looking directly at the speaker, it's very easy to accidentally hit the Bluetooth pairing button when attempting to turn the volume up, or to hit the center button when trying to turn the volume down. The center button is just the logo, which gives no indication to what it actually does (multifunction play/pause/skip), which is fine if you own the speaker but not great if you ask someone else to change songs. Finally, the buttons have that mushy, silicone feel that makes you wonder if you actually activated it, and despite attempting to clean them, they look very worn after only a few presses. I know that some of this was probably done to improve the waterproofing of the speaker. I have to wonder who the audience is supposed to be, then. Are people taking these into the ocean? Or into their swimming pools at home? Or dancing in the rain? It just doesn't feel like a common enough use case to warrant the trade off.These small-ish quibbles aside, I've enjoyed the speaker and I think it's still the best option at this price point. I just think if could be even better.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2021",AE5NTZ7O2YOXZWMEJINA5PB7YMBA,True,0,Color: Black

While not quite as good as the Sonos speakers, for the $$ these speakers nail the sound. Pairing 2 speakers in a stereo pair is very easy.The speakers have multiple sound presets and a 9-band EQ configurable via the mobile app. (NOTE: I also bought the Space Q45 NC headphones and used the HearID recommended 8-band EQ settings for configuring the Motion+ EQ.) I absolutely love the sound from the speakers with my custom EQ settings for Rock, Blues, and Metal.I can't speak to the battery life because I bought Anker USB power adapters and all 4 speakers are connected to power 100% of the time.The mobile app is serviceable, but short on extra features. For instance, the app only tracks one pair of the Motion+ speaker pairs at a time. The app has to disconnect from one set to connect to another. Also there is no L/R fader function in the app to adjust the balance between the paired speakers. I have submitted requests to Anker Soundcore support to add features to remember devices and customize the names, and to add the fader feature.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Motion+ speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2023",AF362OS3S3ZXUTFMGPOFXHLFFDGA,True,1,Color: Black

The best Soundcore offered was a very slight discount if I bought a THIRD one directly from them. Instead I'm returning my latest purchase and keeping the older one (mostly as a paperweight).As far as sound quality goes, these are OK but not great. With enough fiddling on the app you can adjust the sound quality so it is quite acceptable on low volume on a patio, for example. Unadjusted the speakers sound fairly muddy to me, even though they have absolutely no low bass. Frankly for the about the same cost as two of these, you can do far better by buying two unpowered speakers and a cheap China-made class D amplifier.","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2024",AFNIJGL37B6LJMADBWJTOLGFLZQQ,True,0,Color: Black

R13LBUHRSCD1IP,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Better The Longer I've Had It!,DrNik,4,"Update 7/15/2021:Perhaps there was a break-in period on this unit because the longer I've had it the better it sounds even at higher volumes! Since everyone's hearing is different, I really recommend using the Soundcore app on your phone and do Custom EQ settings that sound right to you. I didn't like any of the EQ Presets. So I have officially changed my mind and increased my rating from 3 to 4 Stars. I think this was worth the price and would definitely recommend this BT Speaker.Original From Feb. 2021:I'm a bit disappointed for the price considering it supposed to be 30W of power. Thought I would take the chance since it has separate left and right mid-range and tweeter drivers. There are so many positive reviews and youtube videos comparing this to the larger JBL Charge 4 and others. In my opinion this doesn't sound as good or pack the punch of the smaller JBL Flip 4 or 5. I put the Soundcore app on my phone, tried the BassUp and all EQ Presets. It sounded better with my own Custom EQ settings.It sounds pretty good up to half volume. Going above that and there is distortion in the mid-range and treble, and gets worse the higher it goes. The max volume is tied to my Bluetooth device, and once the max is reached on the device then pressing the volume up on the speaker has no effect. On other BT speakers like JBL & Sony I can increase the volume more on the speakers after the BT sources is at max volume.Listening to quality music is very important to me and 98% of my music library is full CD quality FLAC files. Either I got a defective unit or Anker is putting out a lot of dishonest review and videos. I'm thinking about returning this and going with the JBL Flip 5 even though it has only 1 active Transducer driver. Anker had a good idea here for a compact BT speaker, but it doesn't live up to all the hype.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021",AEOUB25MPZ4HGZQTKKUXWTPU5JLQ,True,0,Color: Black

R37HUI3EPME03Y,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Solidly built, great sound, in a perfect package",Sean Mckenzie,5,"I love this thing! First off, I think it looks good. I like that one can see the speakers through the grill, while feeling confident that said speakers are well protected, since themesh is metal not fabric. This will make wiping it down easier, too. I hate fabric speaker covers, they're dust magnets and a pain to clean.The sound: Remarkable! Especially for such a small sized unit. Honestly, it looks bigger in the photos, and it's the perfect size for any shelf or table. The sound is so crisp and clear, yet you can honestly feel the bass, and that's not even with the Bass boost enabled. The Soundcore app is easy to use and gives you access to an EQ mixer, as well as a range of presets. I use the EQ mixer, and you can clearly hear the difference as you adjust. It's also clearly well made. The unit feels hella solid and it's surprisingly heavy, which is a good thing! You're not likely to find great quality sound and quality construction in a plastic, lightweight speaker. This bad boy has a metal body and feels solid AF.My only knock would be that the control buttons on top of the unit are unlit, and the same color (black) as the rest of the unit, making it difficult to see which button is which. But this is really pretty minor, given that most of us will use the soundcore app or our music app, to adjust the controls instead of manually with the hard to read buttons. Also, once you learn which does what, it's a non-issue.I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants a high quality portable speaker with excellent sound-for-size/price. You cannot go wrong, and Anker is a quality company with excellent customer service, so you can buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2022",AHQ5345MK2FWM32RKP67X3GAQW2A,True,2,Color: Black
R3T2WS82BPF7A3,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars A larger, louder version of the Boost.",Dalton Boehm,4,"I ordered this Bluetooth speaker to replace my Anker Soundcore Boost that served me well for 3 years as a speaker for my PC.As a higher priced device, I was hoping that it would be an improvement in sound quality over my former speaker. But it’s about the same, maybe even a little worse. The speaker sounds pretty flat out of the box and you need to use the Soundcore app on your phone to EQ it for a richer, wider sound. This EQ doesn’t stay when you disconnect from your phone and use a computer (there’s no soundcore app for windows.) overall the default sound is acceptable but I’m sure there’s speakers out there that sound better for $100 (I got the speaker for about $80 with a sale.)The speaker is also way bigger and heavier than the Boost. The boost is pretty easy to pack in a camping bag or backpack but the Motion is a bit unwieldy and awkward.The upside for this is that the battery should be much better and it is notably louder, but those two perks are irrelevant for my use case and the Boost was loud enough with a good enough battery.If you’re considering this speaker, I’d go for the Soundcore Boost instead.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2023",AGDCVTOYPW4DSRPI3477OGIPO2QA,True,2,Color: Black

However, I couldn’t get this feature to work.After trying all the trouble shooting steps on their website, I called Soundcore. They said that their engineers changed the Bluetooth chip on the newer speaker version and that’s why my 2 speakers wouldn’t pair.Fortunately, I was just a few days within my warranty and they told me to send the older one back and that they would ship out a replacement with the new chipset.Hopefully, the stereo pairing will work once I receive it.

Gaming is somewhere between my laptop and desktop speakers, but certainly better than the latter so they serve their purpose as I'm not going to lug around my desktop speakers.For the price should have come with a case, and also a wall charger and USB cord.

He immediately ordered two more Emberton II’s so we could both enjoy the stacking feature.The only disappointment is that it doesn’t stack in stereo. So you don’t get that speaker interplay from stereo recordings.To stack, only connect one of the two speakers via bluetooth to your device. Then follow the instructions for button pressing to stack the second one, without connecting it to the same device via bluetooth. The speakers connect to each other independently.

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,168,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,12,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term.

Having used Bose Sound Link and similar speakers over the years, I noticed this B&O A1 2nd generation on sale and decided to purchase it based on my previous experiences with B&O. For roughly $200 US dollars on sale, I decided to purchase this speaker because of it’s relatively small footprint, having Amazon Alexa built in, and the sound quality (60 watts total power) of B&O. The design and build quality are what you’d expect from B&O. Beautiful brushed aluminum and a nifty little hand loop for carrying, the large donut-shaped speaker lies flat, while dispersing 360 degree stereo sound.After charging the battery to full, I quickly added the speaker via my iPhone’s Bluetooth settings and then upgraded the speaker software via the B&O app. You can easily change the sound output of the speaker through the customizable EQ settings via the app. Amazon Alexa is easily setup (via the Alexa app) and works like it’s supposed to. There are 3 microphones on the speaker and they function well. Sound is clear and bright. Soundstage is fairly wide for this little speaker and the volume gets plenty loud for my needs.Overall, I would recommend this product as an amazing value to anyone who wants a little BT speaker from B&O. It is water and dust proof (IP67 rated) and easily fits into a backpack or travel bag. In terms of durability, time will tell, but this thing is built like a tank, and weighs just one pound. I have not had any Bluetooth connectivity issues and the battery is rated to last 18 hours after a full charge (3 hours charging time via included USB-C cable). Any changes to the aforementioned specs and I’ll update this review. All in all, I’m happy with this purchase. If you like B&O, you can’t go wrong with a portable speaker at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGJ3UD45S2JMZJRBYSF4HA2FLJWA,True,4,Color: Anthracite
R2U5KOZF4OEAHD,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Best one that i tried out of several,Peter Dapice,5,"I ordered about a dozen bluetooth speakers so i can try them side by side.Honestly, most were really good when listened to by themselves, but once you start comparing them in an A/B test you really start to hear the subtle differences that make some speakers better than others.This speaker is not the best for booming bass, so if that's your thing, you may want to look elsewhere.what you do get is a clear, accurate and wide sound stage. There is low end to be had and i think it is in perfect balance in contrast to some other speakers that were so bass forward as to be a bit boomy.The speaker is also very aesthetically pleasing, lightweight and easy to take with you for traveling.Bluetooth connectivity was quick, easy and 100% hassle free whereas some of the other top models out there had trouble connecting or random disconnects or dropouts.my only complaint - if i absolutely had to make one - would be that it does not come with any type of carrying or travel case. A simple felt bag would have been nice just to protect it from scuffs or scratches, but i can probably find an old Crown bag or something to put it in.Buy this speaker - you WILL like it","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2024",AEC2L4L6EOG2OPWLALWQNGLO6DYQ,True,12,Color: Anthracite
R3AUXRX3JOHE81,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent - Perfect for minimal Mac setup,Donovan Dillon,5,"I purchased the B&O Beosound A1 2nd Gen to improve my MacBook Pro - based, 2 cable (1 monitor power cord, 1 USBC to drive the external monitor + power my MacBook Pro) work from home setup. My work area is limited and in the middle of my kitchen / living / dining area — so aesthetics are also a factor.I specifically wanted: (1) reliable, high quality audio for conferencing and music, (2) small footprint, (3) cable-free / wireless operation, and (4) long battery life.On paper, the B&O Beosound A1 seemed ideal; however after extensive research I felt like I would be paying a premium for the small form factor while compromising on sound quality (ref Alan Ross YouTube videos) and perhaps battery life. I decided to take the plunge as I could return the unit if it disappointed.The unit was delivered on time and I was very impressed with the packaging, instruction booklet, physical quality, and straightforward button layout. Setup and software update using the B&O iOS app was intuitive and almost effortless. Pairing the unit with my MacBook Pro and selecting the microphone and speaker in MacOS preferences was routine. The unit charged from 80% to 100% using my MacBook Pro USBC power adapter in about 2 hours. I immediately tested music playback and found it acceptable and inline with Alan Ross’s review (good highs and mids, less than robust bass, and sound quality highly sensitive to speaker placement / tweeter orientation). I also observed that the unit would power off after a period of inactivity and was concerned that I might have to reset the speaker and microphone connections after turning the unit back on. All in all these were potential complications I could live with.The unit passed its inaugural 1 hour Microsoft Teams meeting / video conference with flying colors the following day: powering it up reestablished wireless Bluetooth pairing, plus microphone and speaker assignments; and audio quality was reliable and exceptional throughout the meeting. This is the primary reason I purchased the unit, so I was ready to claim mission accomplished. However, a surprise was in store.After my conference call I decided to check battery level using the B&O app — the unit was at 95% after a few hours of experimenting with music playback, letting the unit sit overnight and a 1 hour conference call in the morning. That was reassuring, but while in the app my attention was drawn to the app’s Equalizer feature which I had glossed over during setup and did not examine during my prior musical exploration -- so I decided decompress to random selections from my Apple Music library while also testing the equalizer settings.Wow, I was blown away by the difference in sound quality using the equalizer — particularly the Ambient setting. I listened to selections from John Williams, Florence + the Machine, Acadia, Los Lonely Boys, Makaveli, Chick Corea, James Blake, Lydia Low, Ani DiFranco, Prince, Coldplay, Matisyahu, Public Enemy, Anthony and The Johnsons, Yael Naim and others. The range featured classical, R&B, rock, reggae, metal, alternative, singer songwriter, vocal, instrumental, a cappella — an excellent sample of what I listen to — and nothing disappointed: Sound clarity is excellent, highs are bright, mids are uniform and punchy, lows are deep and moving for a 5"" speaker, and volume is excellent for my use case (personal audio — not throwing a party).Net-net: It turns out that the Beosound A1 2nd Gen was a no compromises purchase for my requirements. The form factor perfectly matches my minimal Mac setup, the conferencing functionality is great and the sound quality is exceptional for my musical tastes. This product is of the best purchases I’ve made.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2020",AHPIX7L5UB644PBPAWIU5VMTR3LQ,True,108,Color: Anthracite

R17Q6ULQ338WRA,B085R7TSN6,1.0 out of 5 stars Speaker FAILED 3 days outside the 30 day return window.,Peter,1,"It's not often when I feel like a purchase is just a mistake. This is one of those times. I trusted Bang & Olufsen brand to not only sound great but to be high quality and for them to support their products. After purchasing 2 of these so I could have a ""stereo pair"", I shouldn't have purchase either.To be clear (pun intended), the speakers sound great! The Bluetooth connectivity to configure the stereo pair is clunky and has to be re-set every time you use them. Not the end of the world but not what I would expect from B&O. The issue I have is that one of the speakers FAILED 3 days outside the 30 day return window at Amazon. Again, NOT what I would expect from a premium B&O product. But I could almost live with this too.What I couldn't live with is that after 45 min on the phone wit Bang & Olufsen and their tech support determining that the speaker was faulty after 3 uses and owning it for 33 days, THEY NEED A FULL MONTH to do an inspection and determine whether or not the speaker should be replaced? Seriously? I've owned it for a month and your tech just said it is defective. Now I have to go back to send it back to you for another month to look at it? Not OK.Failures and quality issues happen. We understand that. But we'll be sticking with companies that stand behind their products in meaningful ways and don't put their customers in the middle of their manufacturing issues in the future.If you get a speaker that works, you'll like the sound. If you get one that fails, you're in for a long ride.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AGPLNWPFVK6COM2RFDE5AO3WBBUA,True,12,Color: Anthracite

R38H6S9H6NZ0KC,B085R7TSN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Don't believe every review you read, especially negative ones.",CP,5,"Don't believe every review that you read...and only take isolated reported connectivity issues with a grain of salt, especially when they are incorrect. i.e. bluetooth 5.1 connectivity distance etc. Most connectivity issues in my 35 yrs of tech experience are due to ""user error"". Beyond that most can be, and are corrected with a firmware update. Now that being said, my opinion of course here on this unit follows. I have only had this 2nd generation Beosound A1 for a day, so keep that in mind. But right out of the box, this is the best sounding truly portable speakers that I have ever heard, period. Amazingly so, in fact that I have ordered a two more to fit an application that required exactly what these A1's offer. Beautiful clean sound that is loud enough in a large hockey puck style footprint the can be placed under a kitchen cabinets trim, virtually out of sight. How awesome it that? I had zero connectivity issues, and as a matter of fact I was surprised how well the connectivity worked with my iPhone, iPad, and 12"" MacBook. Just as you would expect from a Bluetooth 5.1 device! I cannot and will not comment on Alexa connectivity because if I wanted Alexa capability I would just fire up one of the useless Alexa units that I have in my closet. I can only suspect B&O added Alexa capability because they have some licensing deal with Amazon. As for battery usage I have only had it for a day. But if it comes close to the 18 hours as listed this is even more a winner. And of course this is really portable so you can just plug it as you do your phone to fully charge in 2.75 hours. As for the microphones to be used as a conferencing type device....pretty cool. Though I have not tested them. It will be a bonus if they work as well as the rest of this device's features. You have to keep in mind that if you want Alexa, Siri, Google, and tele-conferencing capabilities you ALWAYS have to purchase dedicated devices for those needs.. If you can get a device like the B&O A1 (2ND GEN) that is ""primarily"" a portable battery operated speaker that you can bring to the beach to be just decent at those other things then you are way ahead of the game.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AE23O75IIZVYP34WJST2EBUB4KXA,True,17,Color: Sport

R1GFKXWY2U1CG7,B085R7TSN6,2.0 out of 5 stars Just get a different speaker for around this price bracket.,Louis Valencia,2,"I've been using this speaker since February and I've given it a very long chance, but I keep finding things to dislike about it.I tend to use this speaker at work after we close at my big retail store since there's enough space between me and my other coworkers for me to just enjoy my music and for them to have their own speakers blasting and enjoying their music. THEIR speakers sound better and are louder than this one whether it's a JBL, Tribit, Sony, or Bose speaker. I'll pass by and their music drowns mine. So before I get to specifics, tl;dr, everything I'm about to say is just going to call back to this: just get something else for this price bracket because this speaker will disappoint you.Battery life? This thing will last you roughly 3 hours at max volume. How do I know that? My store closes 5 hours into my shift and I'm using it for the last 3 hours of my shift and by the time I clock out it either already died or is about to die. It also takes an eternity to charge to full. You basically need to leave it overnight for it to charge so if I ever forget to charge the thing 3 hours before my shift, it's not going to charge to full. I had a JBL Clip 4 I got for 60 bucks that lasted longer than this and charged better. Other nitpick about charging this thing is the fact that it turns on automatically when you connect a charger to it and you have to wait a little more than 5 seconds to be able to turn it off. It's annoying.Sound? It sounds fine when it's right next to you. The quality and bass is real nice. But if you step more than 10 feet away from it or if you're at a specific angle away from this speaker, the quality just dips drastically. Like I said, the main thing I really care about it is how loud it is and every other speaker in the $100 bracket around me just outclasses this thing. This thing is in the $200 bracket. I'll step a few feet away from my speaker and barely hear it, but I'll definitely hear my coworkers' speaker from the next aisle over.How does it look? I've seen a lot of reviews saying, ""Oh wow this thing has some kick to it for how small it is!"" This thing is not small. They're lying. Those reviews will make you think it's as no bigger than a teacup plate. No, this thing is surprisingly big and bulky. It will not fit in most hoodie pockets. You cannot clip it to anything because it is also heavy. This thing literally looks like and is the size of a smoke detector.Bluetooth connectivity? Yeah it's pretty good. Very annoying though when I plug it in to charge and it automatically turns on and thus connects to my phone and starts playing sound through it. Like seriously, why is this a feature?Anyways, yeah.

Seems this high end brand is pushing a product aimed at a utilitarian application and failing.The trouble started immediately on charging and powering the speakers on. Setup is temperamental. Okay, no sweat. But once set up the units constantly dropped Bluetooth signal causing a popping sound, disrupting the media, and toggling in and out of stereo mode. Stereo pairing was barely functional.Thinking this might be battery related, I purchased a 3x1 USB charger to try the units in an external powered state, which was markedly better. But the signal loss persisted, if less frequently.I decided to perform further testing: the laptop.The B&O performs as poorly with the laptop (2022 HP i7) as the Android with Bluetooth connectivity dropping approx. once per minute at less that 3ft of distance. My wife's $20 bluetooth speaker connected flawlessly under the same conditions, same day and weather.

No can do!I am a professional and I demand reliability.As for sound it's pretty clean, but I fail to hear 2x $250 worth of WOW! I opted for Jazz but I also tinkered with Metal and Hip Hop. For Jazz it performed well enough. I would not recommend these speakers to fans of Rock, Rap or Country. Perhaps Classical? The bass is anemic, which is unsurprising for a 4"" driver. I wasn't expecting night club bass. Maybe they want me to shell out another $700 for a sub. Would it sync? Forget it.These speakers do not connect successfully enough to be useful for audio reproduction of any kind, let alone deserving of ""audiophile"" status. Imagine a fancy sports car that won't run. What will your hot date think of your broken down Ferrari, waiting for a tow truck on the side of the expressway? Not much. It simply doesn't work.Give me a Ford F-150 that runs, which is why I might consider something like Bose. I would say that's a fair comparison. B&O have their place but it is not your family barbecue. Maybe Bose or JBL isn't the top of the audiophile line, but if it syncs and plays it is 1000x better than this mess.Avoid.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023",AEROHBBCRM7TESY3O5YRCC5WLP3A,True,2,Color: Anthracite

B&O offers an app to do that, but it was not recognized by the iOS meaning that iTunes music and other apps used the internal loudspeaker of the phone. Shutting down the B&O app and switching Bluetooth on and off for several times to discover the loudspeaker finally worked.

It does not connect without making it work each time. The B&O connects instantly and if you want to hear all your instruments as I do, don't get the Roam. The B&O gives me great pleasure to listen to. I would put the Bose Soundlink Mini II is my second favorite, and the Sonos third. The Sonos Roam, some like, but a muted sound compared to the full range B&O. The Beosound A1 Gen2 has perfect bass but not the thundering bass on the Roam. Some might like the Roam better, was very disappointed the muffled sound and connectivity.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2023",AHHKGG2W57BNXGM4A3FO4V5AVWUQ,True,7,Color: Green
RUNGSE4G00QBH,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars The right settings and location make a difference,Professional Courtesy,5,"So, I’ve been a Bose fan for three decades. For outdoor use I’ve owned the Bose Soundlink (2, actually). It has decent sound for a small unit, although the batteries have tended to die prematurely.I looked for a new option and ran across this B&O unit. I knew the company had a good reputation for quality audio, but had never owned any of their gear. When I initially purchased the A1, I thought, this is okay, but not better than my Bose that cost half as much. Then I began tinkering with the streaming music from my iPad. Two things: 1) On an iPad/iPhone go to Settings>Music>EQ and hit Rock. That brings out the highs and lows of this speaker. 2) Also, I think several weeks of use “loosened up” the speakers and allowed for an improved audio experience. I’m no audiophile, but it simply sounded better after some use.One tip: put the speaker about 1’ from a wall for maximum bass.The bottom line is, the speaker sounds fantastic, even at lower volumes. It is well built and feels substantial in your hand. I absolutely love it. In all fairness to Bose, I’ve not heard the Revolve II. It is far larger than the B&O, but is not nearly a sexy or portable.Spend the money. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2022",AEGY4CVVWVYGN5UGUPOU6TRCR5DA,True,2,Color: Sport

RNH3RU6JCMI9F,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Honest opinion,theRecipe,5,"Original review: After spending 6+ hours with this speaker one thing that I have noticed is that its a personal speaker. You can set it next to you at a lower volume, pump up the bass to a level you want through the companion app and get a full sound, all the while the person on the other end of the couch can barely hear it. Or you can turn it up for others to hear. I added a personal EQ setting that upped the bass so at lower volumes I could have a more full sound. From there as I increase the volume, I move to the “Ambient” setting and I guess if I cranked it loud enough I would move on to the “Optimal” setting. I think it just depends on how much bass you want.I ordered a second one to test the stereo sound on this. I’ve read some people had issues with this, so it might not work out. I’ll update this with my findings.Update 1: I found pairing 2 beoplay A1’s into stereo mode is easy. I had no issues with it. It does not sound any louder in stereo but it sounds good. You can also choose to set them up in mono mode and they sound much louder this way.Update 2: In the end I returned both speakers, I thought they sounded excellent but for $500.00 I could get more sound for less. I ended up with the UE Hyperboom. It’s stereo or mono, it sounds extremely good turned down low and excellent turned up from medium to high.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2021",AELTNTCH226APEWUWWQE34OFKKEA,True,6,Color: Anthracite

I am not an audiophile but I do listen to a variety of music, from jazz and pop to classical, electronic, and sound baths.

No treble screech when pushed…in fact, very little notable distortion when cranking it up with TI or Electric Six. A very enjoyable sound that can be listened to without ear fatigue.BUT…..it has one very annoying habit. When plugged in to charge, it immediately turns itself on and then connects to any active Bluetooth connection it can locate, many times disconnecting what’s already connected. No other wireless speaker I’ve used does this, incl Bose, JBL, Oonz, UE, etc. Darned annoying when I’m on my headphones and plug in the B&O to charge only to have it start blasting what was previously thru the cans.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2022",AFTQWWPTSWM4SZ3JHPKSF3HGUQDA,True,40,Color: Sport

I have two complaints, though: the Bluetooth interface is terrible. If, for example, you have the BT connection set to ""calls and audio"", Everytime you get an sms, the sound feed goes into pause mode. The speaker auto-connects to it's last paired device so, for example, if you have both a cell phone and a tablet that you use with the B&O device, you literally need to turn BT off on one (the previous) device to avoid the B&O device from doggedly trying to reconnect with the former device that it was paired with while you're in setup mode. Also, the Gen 2 A1 frequently loses it's Bluetooth connection which puts whatever you're using to stream into pause mode. Then you have to click on the app to continue when the A1 reconnects.I'm also not overly-enamored with the sound quality. It is good, but not great. And this BT-only speaker has a ""it has to sound great"" price tag. My biggest issue, though, is that B&O got rid of the feature that allowed the previous generation to connect via either wifi or BT. I really miss the ability to just connect it with wifi -- and I'm pretty sure the sound quality would be a lot better.These are not huge issues, but when we're talking about equipment from a high-end company like B&O, I expect complete transparency and perfect functionality. And this misses that mark from various standpoints.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2021",AF5LR7NND6IRO7NTDBUTZNKUG2HA,True,4,Color: Grey Mist

I'm an electrician and am usually working in open framed houses. I'll place the speaker in a center of a room and listen to it as a I work. I find that the speaker volume has to be on medium-high for me to use that way. Which means I end up having to charge the speaker every day after work to have it ready for the next day.The speaker is more situated in single room environments.

R3PDX409HMFZ0H,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Stunning deep green speaker with equally stunning sound-worth every penny!,Jennifer Gill,5,"I love the B & O app, the customer service agent was fantastic to help me with set up, and the sound quality of this powerhouse of a little speaker brings me much joy.I also purchased earbuds from B & O in the same green and was blown away by the quality of both of these. I cannot over state the quality of the aesthetics on this company's designs. The quality is just what I want and expected and this speaker brings opulence to my environment every day in appearance, functionality and sound quality!The only thing I wish is that I could use this as a Google Voice Assistant instead of Alexa speaker. My Bose home speaker is quite pricey and sounds fantastic as well, though it is wired, and has Google Assistant options on it. Why, B & O, can't you allow us to have Google Voice Assistant on these? Applause otherwise on everything else. I am so thrilled with this speaker. Worth every penny!","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2021",AEOSAPVH5VCZ2OUUUANHW4DUSNPQ,True,1,Color: Green
REPJSQXAHXE4,B085R7TSN6,1.0 out of 5 stars Terrible Bluetooth and less than average sound.,Lahn,1,"Please read the 1-star reviews before purchasing.I don't know if I received a lemon or what but this went right back in its box for a return.The Bluetooth connection felt like 2000. It would constantly disconnect. Literally, every minute. I haven't had this problem for decades. I think it was OK as long I'd use my phone (ie, less than 1 foot away). If I'd use the Alexa function (which is what I purchased it for), it was unusable.The sound, out of the box, was also very disappointing. I did a firmware update. I think it made it even worse... And that's when it went back in the box.I just gave up on an ""Alex-enabled"" portable speaker and ended up purchasing an Anker SoundCore Motion 300 for a fraction of the cost. I'm very happy now!","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AFFIXMNJRFQRIGZO4CW3ZRFTJYHA,True,0,Color: Anthracite
R2UTWNRGGAS8JZ,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars It ain't cheap but it's good,gameshoes,5,"For its size, the sound quality is great. I do have some songs that it just doesn't handle all that well though. Battery life is amazing. I use it at work for about 6.5 hours (at about 40% volume), then about an 1.5 hours more at home (at about 30% volume), and only need to recharge it once a week. Yes, turning up the volume will require more power. But, if you just like adding ambiance, keeping it below half volume gives great endurance.Bluetooth delay greatly depends on the app being used. For most video streaming purposes, the lag was minimal to where it wasn't a distraction. Games were a few seconds behind which makes this not a good experience.Using the speaker for phone calls worked well.Since I use it daily, it has quite a few dings. At work, I tie it around my belt so it does get hit once in a while. The scuffs really do show, and not gracefully contrary to the advertising.Price may be a pain point for some buyers.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020",AHWHHUFODHW3F62NH5CC4SNVNVZQ,True,21,Color: Grey Mist

Bass is easy for any speaker manufacturer to offer. Treble and midrange are much more difficult and expensive to get right. B&O offers a fuller range of music than anything JBL has to offer. The younger generations are being duped into thinking bass is the main feature. Again, that's easier and cheaper to get right. Even so, two of the JBL units we tried mushed out the bass at higher volumes. Not this unit.

But after having this for several years, there are just too many short falls in comparison to my other travel size speakers.Battery life has dropped down to abyssal levels after intermo use over the last two years. Im talking, 3 hours at modest volume at most. I've never seen battery degradation like this, despite making sure I followed typical protocols for battery life during this time. It may have also been sub par to begin with in terms of battery life, but I find myself blown away with how quickly it dies nowadays.The app is horrible, and the Bluetooth connectivity is always a chore. Sometimes I will take me 15 min of switching the speaker on and off, Bluetooth on and off on the device, forgetting the device, re pairing, etc until I get it to work... Which always seems to be random. And it's not just my phone - my wife and kids phones have the same issue, whether using the B&O app or not. Ive never had a Bluetooth device act so poorly in my life. This alone is not worth the hassle.Build quality is great. Solidly built. Sounds decent but not exceptional for the price.

The microphone quality is awful - grainy, far-away, and distant, and I've gotten complaints from every person I've tried to call on this thing. Furthermore, it has a ""speakerphone mode"" which degrades both input and output quality of the device, and you can't switch it off if you're using the microphone, ie. you can't use this speaker to play high-quality audio while you use a different microphone.The audio quality is good but pairing it with the MacBook Pro which has no system-level equaliser out the box and no B&O app, it's annoyingly bassy when I don't want it to be. It shuts off automatically after a period of time which means I have to re-pair it with my MacBook every now and again if I'm not listening to something continuously, and the Bluetooth pairing isn't alway successful.Overall, nice music-playing speaker.

The sound is fine but at its loudest, is probably just enough to hear from another room and be okay. But my main problem is that it vibrated off my bathroom sink twice and fell to the floor. My Bose speaker never had done this so it was surprising though you’d think I would have learned after the first time. I thought perhaps I had placed it precariously and then it fell after the vibrations moved it. But no, even though the bottom FEELS like it’ll keep it stationary, it doesn’t, so I have to hang it from its rope on my doorknob.I want to love it more than I do.

R3LYZE987ADOQH,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit Stormbox Pro Versus Bose Soundlink Revolve.,Chris,5,"I have both of these speakers and am offering a comparison. These are my opinions for what they’re worth. The bottom line is that the Tribit Stormbox Pro is a better value than the Bose Soundlink Revolve.Sound:Both of these speakers provide excellent room-filling sound that is decidedly different. The Bose is more ambient with a mono feel, which it is. The bass and mid-range are good but there is very little in the way of high treble. For example, you probably won't hear that classic ""ping"" in middle of ""Comfortably Numb"". Bose, being Bose, provides no information about what is inside the casing. My guess is that there is one woofer and a single transducer.Tribit, on the other hand, emits more of a surround sound which actually seems stereophonic. Bass is thumping amazing with the booster on, mid-range is fine and and very high notes come through loud and clear. Some reviewers describe this as ""Tinny""; I don't think so. Tribit openly discloses that there is a subwoofer, 2 transducers and 2 passive radiators.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. At lower volume, the sound quality is equal. Tribit wins at moderate to high volume with the Extra Bass activated.Functionality:Bose has 5 control buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, volume + and -, and one more which I haven’t figured out but things get messed up whenever I push it. An audio cable port is provide if you can’t connect via Bluetooth for some reason. The optional Bose charging cradle is the worst accessory ever designed in history - don’t waste your money. Bose rates the speaker as IP55 water resistant.Tribit has 4 buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, and volume + and -). The Tribit also shows battery power. The Stormbox Pro has a carrying strap which is a great idea; I’ve dropped my Bose a couple times. Tribit rates the speaker as IP67 water proof.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. The controls are simpler.Price:Right now, the Bose Soundlink Revolve (Series II) is $219 and the Tribit Stormbox Pro is $119.95 with a 20% coupon ($95.96).ADVANTAGE: Tribit. Bose is over-priced.Appearance:The Bose exterior is solid plastic and durable. Tribit has a high-quality fabric exterior and looks good. The Stormbox is 1” higher than the Revolve.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Battery:I’ve never had an issue with my Bose’s battery. The manufacturer claims 13 hours of playtime. Tribit claims to provide 24 hours of play time and has a port for charging your cell phone.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Durability:One thing you have to hand to Bose, their products are built to last. Despite the fact I cannot attest to the Tridbit's durability - Bose gets the vote.Advantage: BoseSummary:The Tribit Stormbox Pro is an amazing portable speaker at under $100. It meets or beats the Bose SoundLink Revolve in all categories. I don’t know how it would match up against the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ with runs $329.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2021",AG6WESEHODYUI74XLBFEQWAEAEKQ,True,61,

We rarely leave reviews unless our purchase was something we found excellent with great value. We have purchased 4 portable speakers to connect to our Dell 7200 2-in-1 which is a tablet and laptop. The factory sound is weak, flat an horrible and is not worth seeing a movie online. We have tried both a sound bar and aux. speaker. Most provided a wireless bluetooth and a wired connection. The Tribit's bluetooth was easy, stable and remains connected without issue or having to re-connect like our other bluetooth speakers. The sound is awesome, clear and distortion free. Our music taste goes from blues, jazz, soft rock and classical. Our movies vary. But this speaker sounds better at reproducing sound with much higher volume that is clear and sharp with little to distortion. The sound with only one speaker fills the room like a surround sound speaker system. We decided to purchase a 2nd Speaker and it was suggested. Today, I am very happy when my purchase exceeds my expectations as the Tribit did. With a discount and coupon our cost was only $95 and this was the best money we ever spent on a laptop speaker!!!

I literally have owned these speakers, ranked from 1 to , 1 being the best speaker I have ever owned in the portable Bluetooth speaker category. Keep in mind, I'm just the average everyday, in my car with 2 12 in subs by JL audio, Bose highs and lows (Armada SUV), and home entertainment center that is a old late 80s Marantz Amplifier attached to 2 Marantz floor 15s with highs and mids within the speakers. So, I'm no audiophile, no schooling to know notes and ranges or frequencies, just know when it is at 100 volume, is it distorted, does the bass give out at every hit if battery is half dead (Sony Bluetooth Speakers), and a few other important things I must have in a speaker such as; distance before the karate chopping the song to death starts, can it charge my phone as well (at a speed of 1.5a or higher if that even has hit a speaker yet), MAH capacity has to be 3000 or higher, portability is important, weather resistant is minor, I'm 45 and no longer desire to be with homies regardless of weather conditions or at a beach I'm black so I'm straight, I'll keep my ass indoors if it rains and pool parties was 20 years ago ipwhatever is only for my phone. Speaker who gives two turds, as long as it hits those marks I'm hella happy. Here we are and where this bad boy/girl ranks in my list of yompers.My list of amazing speaks/yompers1. Soundcore Select Pro: absolutely hands down best of it's class by a Seattle Slew distance. Price is unbeatable at 55 dollars during December, regular 90 dollars. Reason you don't see it on Amazon, cause soundcore realized they sold it at a way to cheap price and rebranded it with the motion boom, motion boom is second but the select Pro is by far all around number 1 which includes any JBL Bose Sony or pick one, soundcore nailed it.2. Motion boom soundcore: same as select Pro but more money and bigger battery. Oh they charge devices at the Anker iq speed, since soundcore is Anker, makes since.3. Oontz: damn brilliant design, first to do it triangular and the price point is beyond mi dblowing. My first was the smallest one, I ran down stairs demanded my wife stop her job and hear this little walkey sized speaker, not bunch of bass but clarity and loudness unmatched, 20 dollars and 69 for the biggest one and get 2 of the biggest one they make and they just passed soundcore due to stereo sound and only 120 and you have a speaker, really 2 that sound studiesqe.4. This speaker. Almost a tie with oontz big boy but the price of this one has me putting it 4. Had it been more like 49, number 1.5, soundcore is top dawg for awhile just cause of the app and everything involved. This speaker though is super attractive, chicks come up to just want to hold it, sometimes I gotta ask what it is that they want to hold cause I forget I have in hand cause it's not charge (JBL) heavy or awkward like the many out there. It sounds on par with the megaboom 2 from ue.

R6U4AEBND1YAC,B08MZZTH1N,4.0 out of 5 stars *positive update* older version of storm box speaker doesnt pair with the upgraded model,daniel,4,"7/26/23 update:mona from tribit customer service reached out and kindly arranged for an authentic older version of this speaker to be shipped to me direct from their warehouse and so far, the stereo pairing works great and the speakers sound amazing.sound quality is 6 stars out of 5, build quality is also 5/5 stars. battery life is a solid 4/5-these bad boys put out 40 watts each and last at least 8-9 hours. the one snag is bluetooth connectivity; id give these a 3.5/5 unfortunately. i feel the sound quality makes up for it completely but it is annoying when the right or left channel disconnects or goes out of synch with the other speaker when standing in between the speakers or turning the volume up or down. this is a general issue i've experienced with all kinds of tribit bluetooth speakers i have around my house so, if having to turn your speakers on and off in the middle of listening session is a deal breaker you may have to step up to a higher tier of brand.i have them set up in my large family room for music and podcasts and the smaller tribit stormbox go's on my desk connected to my macbook and ipad and i'm very happy with these speakers and this brand. the sound fills the room and the subwoofers are a nice addition.original review:after a year of using this speaker, taking it back and forth to europe and los angeles, using it at the beach, in the bathroom, as a speaker for a TV, laptop, etc, i bought a second 'upgraded' one since i'm so satisfied with the product. i cant wait to pair them together and see how the stereo sounds. it's loud but the bass can be too much sometimes so, play with the volume on your device and speaker to find the right balance you personally prefer. my one friend with the a bose competition speaker without returned her $220 speaker for this one and she's happy with it.UPDATE:down from 5 stars to 3. the 'upgraded' version of the stormbox pro does not pair with the older model i bought ONLY A YEAR AGO. the brand doesn't mention this in its listing; you have to search ""stereo pairing"" in the 'answered questions' section on the amazon page of the upgraded version and the older version doesn't even exist anymore on their official website. very disappointing and shady.the upgraded speaker also sounds slightly muddier and muffled compared to the older version; that can be the space I have the speaker in or the music i listen to but, having both speakers next to me and switching the same devo song between the two, there was a noticeable difference.is this upgraded version still a very good bluetooth speaker worth the price in comparison with its competition? yes.is it loud and really high quality? absolutelyam i still satisfied with the older version i purchased a year ago? definitely. I'm riding that thing til the wheels fall off lol.did i return it? yes. i need two stereo speakers for my personal desk and I do not want nor need to purchase two brand-new, overpowered, 40w bluetooth speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2023",AGWZOATXLMNI7NWVJ76LZ3FF5VKQ,True,6,
R1TN1754KDX4ZW,B08MZZTH1N,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, great value",BGK,5,"I originally had speakers running from an indoor stereo to a pair of outdoor speakers. I redid my outdoor patio area and built a gazebo and was looking to simplify things. I bought a pair of these speakers. Two speakers will pair for stereo sound (left/right channels). I installed hooks into the gazebo rafters and the rubber handles are perfect for hanging them. They sound great. They have been pairing easily without fail since the spring. Once I paired the first time, all I need to do is power them on within proximity of one another for them to enter into stereo mode. Really happy with battery life as well. It would be nice if there was a way to place them into “standby mode” that would enable you to power them on from your phone as opposed to physically having to press the button to turn them on. Again, since I have these hanging up, having to take them down to power them on is a slight inconvenience that I didn’t have to deal with when I was utilizing my WiFi enabled stereo receiver. No regrets on the purchase and glad not to have to maintain hardwired speakers any longer.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AFWACVDE7WMM72BGTYTD6ZPZDBXA,True,2,

I have the Bose revolve and the range from the deep base to crystal clear highs are better than the Bose. That is saying a lot as the Bose is one of the best speakers on the marketBut what really sets this apart is three awsome features that I didn’t even know about when I purchased this speaker. I love that you can have two Bluetooth connections at the same time! Now my wife and I can be paired and take turns playing songs.Then I discovered that if you buy a second Tribit StormBox Pro you can sync them to play in Party mode ( same sound from each for putting into a second room) or play them in stereo mode where one speaker plays the left channel and the other plays the right channel!!With all these features and great sound to also be waterproof makes this speaker the clear choice amongst the many choices in portable speakers.,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AHQVDCQNVNYJD37VMA2GQIGYD6HA,True,0,
RL1GIAX00LDVB,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Needs some adjustments for best sounds,xiao zhang,5,"First of all, this speaker looks and feels premium. I'm gonna go straight to sound quality part. Right out of box, the sound can turn off most people, including me. I almost put the speaker back in the box and returned it. The xbass feature makes very little difference in bass output. Let me put it this way. This speaker is for people who like flat and clean sound. However, after I downloaded the app, the equalizer makes huge improvements. When making adjustments on equalizer, the midrange and highs can be notably different by just tweaking 1 to 2 dbs. Nevertheless, for the bass, you have to tweak 5 to 6 DBS to hear the difference. The bass does not get booming. It's always clean and musical. This speaker is not for bassheads. The bass sounded muddy and almost distorted at the beginning. However, after few days of listening, the bass improved a lot. It got punchier and almost no distortion even at high volume. The overall sound is now balanced and transparent. I compared it to my bose SoundLink. To me, this speaker made bose sounded like there is a curtain in front of it. In conclusion. I am very happy with this purchase.

I decided to upgrade to this particular one and unfortunately the sound is somewhat lacking despite the modern design. The bass is too deep and you need to have the volume up to get a balanced sound. Only thing I can give it is the fact that you can hear almost every sound in the song, it perfectly separates the sounds. I wonder if its one of those speakers where you need two of them to achieve that perfect sound.*Was going to give it 3 stars but realized that the audio I was testing with wasnt good, its not as bad as i thought but still not as balanced as the Tribit MaxSound Plus.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AG5II77UGL3MQ43L6YRDH42AJKVQ,True,0,

R3HL34SIG5WGBR,B08MZZTH1N,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for such a small speaker (just manage your expectations).,Bluesguy,4,"Update:This is a really good sounding and substantially built speaker. Why are people pathologically obsessed with overwhelming and intrusive bass? (and why do people keep spelling it “base”?)My only gripe with this speaker (and just about any good Bluetooth speaker) is the uneven response when turned up. Reviewers blather on and on about how great the bass is without any consideration for even, clean, sound reproduction. I am a rock musician so I like loud bass but I also like to hear the mids and highs as well. Given the size of these speakers there is just so much bass that can be cranked through them and still sound good. The good thing about 60 watts of power is that - even though I can only put the speaker at about 70-80 percent before the bass starts overwhelming the mids and highs - it is still pretty loud for my needs.This is a good speaker but, like most speakers, it just tries too hard to be bass heavy and not smooth and even.Original review:I really like the way this speaker sounds at low to middle volume. At that level the bass has an impressive level and it’s tight sounding. I would have given this speaker a full five stars if the EQ in the app was useful. There aren’t enough bands of adjustment on the EQ and it doesn’t hold the settings. The EQ is also not designed to show you exactly what sound profile is active at any time. Like I mentioned, turned up to about 40-50% the sound is very good. This sucker gets loud. Once one goes over 50% volume the upper mids to the high end start to get very harsh. I find that higher than 50% that killing the bass boost helps a lot. The speakers sound evens out quite a bit when you take off the bass boost at higher volumes. 60 watts of output power doesn’t necessarily mean “louder” than a 40 watt amp, there is just more headroom. I never push any sound device past 80-ish percent because going past that on any speaker/amp or on any sound system is just asking for trouble and disappointment. At 80% the sound is acceptable with the bass boost off. Remember the size of this thing. It’s definitely not a hip-hop thumper bumper. Killing the bass boost actually does make really loud volume sound better. Before I gave up on the EQ in the app I was able to even out the response at higher volume nicely it’s a custom profile. The inability to know what preset was active, and the tendency of the EQ to not even change from one sound profile to another was also annoying. I don’t need to connect 100 speakers or have a rave in my backyard or ever use this on a sandy beach so this speaker works very well sitting on the counter in my bathroom. Overall a very good purchase at the price for my use.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2023",AFZFPPHFXVVWBFJ36DY45MKHWAGQ,True,14,

The sound quality. and that’s 100 percent why you would want a speaker. well let me tell you, every sound, every little bit of melody, every bit of drums, bass, guitar, beats, anything that this speaker plays, you can hear every little detail of production that whoever made that song, you can hear and makes you feel like your in a studio listening to it yourself. And if that wasn’t good enough. The size and portability of it. Big enough to fit even in a purse with a little bit of wiggle room, and if that doesn’t say enough it’s about 7 inches. Thirdly, the price. 90 bucks? Comparing to their competing brands holy cow this is worth every single penny, I think you can notice how much I love this speaker at this point 😂 because I really do especially like a music fanatic like me you want to hear even the littlest of details and this speaker treats that like waking up and drinking cold water in the middle of the night. Heavenly. Best for any medium sized gathering in the backyard independently listening it alone oh and did I mention it was waterproof and with a bass button on the speaker so it even sounds even more crisp?

I wanted something in my living room and knew I would need to pair two speakers together to get the sound I wanted. I had vintage 80’s Fisher tower speakers that couldn’t be beat. I’m a bass freak and it was absolutely necessary to get speakers that could produce at least half the sound and bass of my Fishers. I finally settled on these Tribits, after checking JBL, Sonos, Bose, etc. I was also looking for value in sound. I only bought one first and listened. I liked what I heard and bought the second one. I paired them both and heck yeah !!!! Beautiful sound and clarity ! Beautiful bass ! They have a nice hefty weight to them and they are sturdy and well built. The extra bass boost button absolutely pumps up that bass ! I love the the carrying handle too. Very strong thick rubber. I placed them on the floor by the wall on either end of the living room and the sound was astounding. I definitely felt the surround sound engulf me as these claim to be Hi Fidelity 360’s. I strongly suggest you place them near walls to get the very best sound. I was deeply impressed and quite satisfied with their performance at less than half the volume ! I highly recommend these and they will not break the bank. Amazon currently offers coupons of $25 or more on these.

RBN385A46UFYY,B08MZZTH1N,3.0 out of 5 stars OK for the price range its in but definitely not a B&O.,jtfreelancer,3,"I purchased this speaker along with the Bang and Olufsen Beosound A1 2nd Gen. I was looking for a decently portable water resistant speaker for use around the house and while on vacation. I rolled the dice on the Tribit StormBox Pro because the smaller StormBox Micro has a great review on WhatTheHifi. My criteria were USB C, long battery life 15+ hours, IP67, bluetooth 5 or greater, and AAC support for Apple Hifi.The StormBox Pro sounds like every other midlevel bluetooth speaker (i.e. JBL Flip 5, Sony XB23). It is definitely loud but the sound lacks refinement. It outputs the same sound level at approximately 40% volume as the Beosound outputs at 70%. However, the audio sounds like it is coming out of a can. The enclosure definitely influences the sound. With the B&O you just hear the music and it sounds spacious. The soundstage separates the individual instruments. With the StormBox everything sounds on top of one another. Fine details get lost. If you are wanting to listen to Top 40 super loud at the pool or the beach then the StormBox will be fine. It will have better battery life and you don't have to worry about your $200 speaker walking off or breaking. Plus you can buy two StormBoxes for the price of the B&O.When it comes to deciding between the Tribit and a JBL or Sony it will come down to battery life, size, weight, and if you prefer having an app to change settings like Sony has. I think the sound on all three will be close enough. Flossy Carter has a great review of the SoundBox Pro vs the Flip 5 on YouTube. He also reviews the Beosound.One last note concerning Bluetooth performance. I was looking forward to a range increase from 4.2 devices to 5.0+ devices. I tested the range of an older 4.2 speaker against the StormBox Pro 5.2 and Beosound 5.1. All three speakers started to break up around the same area of my house within a few feet so 5.0+ isn't life changing. Perhaps the transmission quality and battery efficiency are better but I have no way to test that. As a side note, my Airpods 3 performed the best range wise going about 10 feet further than all three bluetooth speakers.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2022",AHYUWEK7XUDF3MFRJTFYA6G4I3AQ,True,5,

RDYDQVKW1BRIH,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for TV satellite speaker setup,mike,5,"Looking for an easy solution to add a satellite speaker to my older Vizio sound bar so that the living room TV could be heard easily in the kitchen, I purchased an Avantree Bluetooth transmitter receiver. The idea was to use the optical passthrough function on the Avantree unit and broadcast the TV sound signal to a portable Bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, most Bluetooth speakers (including Bose) use low quality Bluetooth codecs, which result in enough delay that there was an annoying echo when the Bluetooth speaker and TV speakers were both on. This speaker uses the aptx codec, which has a low latency mode with nearly no delay. I can now have the tv volume at a reasonable low level, and have the Stormbox in the kitchen while cooking or cleaning up, each with independently adjustable volumes. As the Avantree can connect to two devices, I'll probably buy another unit to hack together a whole house sound system for about $300 total.Alone on a flat surface, the speaker sounds okay, but thin. Because of the way sound works, no matter the claims of any speaker brand, speaker cones need to move a lot of air to sound good. No small speaker will ever sound as good as a large multi speaker cabinet. Because I'm pairing this to a sound bar with a woofer, the tinny sound is supplemented by the woofer just fine, and spoken lines from movies and vocals from music actually stand out a little more, which is a good thing in my situation.The Stormbox isn't as pretty as the Bose equivalent, but its laughably better in every other way, for less than half the price.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2022",AHJPDCYC74TKCKO6EEHGLLWYIM7Q,True,0,

Barnes,3,"I kept looking for a reason to keep this speaker but I simply couldn't come up with one. I bought the original Stormbox 4 years ago and it blew me away with the vibrancy and dimensionality I heard, all of it complimented with a bass that punched above its weight. So here it is 2022 and I figured I'd check out the Pro. I expected more of the same, only bigger. That's not happened. Immediately you'll see that the outside of the Pro has more of a clothy feel to it all over.And that's exactly what wrong with speaker.Everything I loved about the original Stormbox is gone in the Pro. The vibrancy is gone, the dimensionality and separation is gone and the music sounds like its trying to come through fabric, robbing the music of its highs and mids. The app was finicky and not intuitive at all. It was hard to work the EQ and I could hardly hear any impact. I was hearing performance in the original; in the Pro, it seems like I was just hearing music coming out of a radio.What you do get with the Pro, however, is much more big, honkin' bass. And, yes, it does get mighty loud. And the bass, even at this size, still punches above weight.Now that's not to say the sound had too much bass but it could've stood to be a bit tighter (but at this price point that's wishful thinking). The amount of bass was fine but I really wanted the mids and highs and dimensionality to come out and join the party as well as they did so much better in the original.This will be a return.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AFDFKRHUG3WVWHCKUTDDB5KFEOAQ,True,8,

The bass response is surprisingly good given the units relatively dimutive size and delivers clean smooth tone. No, it's not going to shatter your windows kinda bass but great nonetheless ( especially with extra bass button enabled).

Bluetooth drop off - from time to time one will experience Bluetooth drop off (note: I have this paired with my iPhone 8Plus and iPad Pro). I experience it when listening to music and then changing app on my iPhone. I also note that when I’m “stereo mode” the Bluetooth range is limited to about 10 feet (between the two speakers) but in “Party mode” I get a range of 30 to 40 feet before I get Bluetooth drop off.2. Switching between the two devices can be cumbersome (I found the best way is to go into the Bluetooth setting in the active device and “disconnect” before switch to the second device).3. Notification (sounds) and answering my iPhone doesn’t always work (but I don’t like answering my phone over the speaker [privacy issues] so for me, this is not a big issue).Edit: After talking w/ Apple Support I discovered that the Bluetooth dropping (when switching between app while listening to music [while connected to my TriBit StormBox Pro]) is an Apple issue w/ their current software (iOS 14.7).

R28LIMJ3DGXLEL,B08MZZTH1N,5.0 out of 5 stars I thought this was supposed to have bass?,Trock,5,"12/28/21 - updateSo I’m not sure what the deal was when I first used this speaker. I’ve used it several days prior, multiple times per day and it’s much louder. I will say the bass won’t work well in certain settings. Example, in my house the bass sounds non existent. In a workout room or larger open areas it sounds much better.So I have a 2nd generation Amazon echo. We use it to listen to music while working out at our house. The sound from the echo has always been surprisingly good, with solid bass for such a small speaker. I think the echo has a 2.5 inch woofer and a smaller tweeter in it. I was hoping to upgrade from it since we got it in 2017. This speaker honestly isn’t really close to that echo bass wise. Clarity wise, the Stormbox sounds good. I’ve listened to it for a day so far and I’m disappointed. Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but a speaker from 2017 shouldn’t sound just as good or slightly better than this speaker I feel like. Im not a huge audiophile pr anything like that, I just wanted something that had some kick. If that’s what you want, this probably isn’t for you. It gets decently loud and sounds clear, but even with the “X-Bass” setting, it doesn’t have hardly any bass.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2021",AGHMTVVT4AEKG56RMRN7LEP323GQ,True,3,

These include the JBL Flip, The Bose Soundlink, The Sony SRS, The UE Boom and others. The problem is that it's an unfair comparison. These speakers are much smaller than the Stormbox Pro and they all perform much smaller as well. To get a fairer comparison, you need the JBl Charge or the UE Mega Boom and the Bose Soundlink Revolve but then, you're in an entirely different price range and I believe this speaker can punch with those guys as well!

For instance, if the volume is on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the lowest audible volume, the volume jumps from a 2 to a 5 with just 1 increase of your phone's volume adjustment. This happens with any phone or app and with both speakers. I emailed Tribit support and they said these are high volume speakers so the overall volume is loud. That doesn't make sense as my car and home audio are significantly louder but have the ability to fine tune lower volume levels.Why is this an issue? We camp and travel a lot and play music by the fire after the kid's go to sleep, and the low volume is barely audible, but then increase it 1 notch and the volume is too loud for quiet hours, there needs to be more steps of adjustment in-between. I think this could be easily fixed with a firmware update.

""Stereo mode"" is nice, and works as expected; but, I am not sure I am going to use it much... I mean, in the situations when I expect to use these speakers I'm not going to care much about stereo sound.

I already knew about the more popular makers like JBL, Bose etc. I found a website comparing the Trinity Stormbox Pro to other top speakers. They liked it so I decided to try out. I'm glad I did. The Tribit plays louder with clarity than my JBL Flip 4 (which is also a great speaker, and is less expensive). The Tribit is IP67 water and dust resistant, has a handy strap for carrying or hanging, and radiates sound in all directions! It's perfect for small to midsized gatherings, or for music in the home where a larger stereo is too much. The battery life is good. We've played it at 2/3 volume for five hours and it was less than half discharged. It pairs easily and stays connected.

Individually, they won't blow you away with their sound quality, but the bass is balanced, the mids are nicely forward without being tinny, and the highs are plenty crisp and clean. Pair two of them together, though, and they really shine. Super cool as a TWS pair, and also quite effective in party mode, which makes the same sound come out of both speakers.

The carry strap is a nice feature, the speakers appear overall well made, controls so far work well, battery life seems to last forever. I also have a Bose Bluetooth speaker that may have a slightly better bass to my ear, but for the money it would have cost twice as much to get two Bose speakers for stereo sound, price difference was not worth it.

ROST70DP2RNLM,B07YFXRNHF,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound in a Small Package,Coolest In Cambridge,5,"I had not really thought about Monster as anything but a legendary maker of premium cables and connectivity hardware. But I picked up the S310 because I wanted something really portable for the back yard this summer. In fact, the convenient wristband caught my attention. Often I'm going downstairs with items for the grill or beverages and don't have a free hand for a Bluetooth speaker. So the carrying strap was a really useful feature. But I am getting ahead of myself.I'm very pleased with this little speaker. Here are the highlights:1) It paired with my phone immediately.2) It connects very quickly.3) The sound quality is much better than I would expect with such a small speaker system. It fills my back yard with clear and full sound. It stays clean near to the very top of its volume range. There is indeed bass, even in such a small driver. Well, actually, there are 2 drivers and a passive radiator. Certainly it is not earth shaking bass. That is just not physically possible from such a compact unit, but the build quality is sufficient to deliver low end to the soundstage. The documentation states that Monster's audio legend, Noel Lee, personally designed and tuned this little guy. It's well-balanced and clean sound gives me no reason to doubt this claim.4) Battery life is impressive so far. After giving it a complete charge, I've been using it for at least 12 hours (of music, not standby) without a recharge at a decent volume.5) Speakerphone mode is actually pretty good. I have another, more expensive Bluetooth speaker with a speakerphone mode and my callers complain that I sound like I'm in a closet. I did not have that experience with the S310. People could hear me and I was not the least bit embarrassed to use it.5) Water resistance is something I have yet to really test. I'm just too chicken to let a nice piece of electronics get wet. It does have a rubber seal to protect the power port and SD slot.6) Oh yeah, the SD card slot. This is not a feature I would use but I could certainly see how it might come in handy. For example, you could load up a card of kids music and let them enjoy it without having to use your phone or give them a tablet. Also, if, heaven forbid, you find yourself without WiFi or a cellular signal, you can still enjoy dozens of hours of music.7) I don't have 2 of these, but if I did, you can pair them so that they will work as left and right channels and double your power. I may take advantage of that.8) The only feature missing, and maybe I'm old fashioned, is a an 3.5 mm aux input. I hardly ever use one of those old things, but I find the a comfort nonetheless. Ah well.While this is about the size of less expensive Bluetooth speakers, you really get what you pay for with the Monster S310. It is a small but loyal audio companion.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2020",AG4XVACLHHE5AS63SPS4XHSHO4YA,True,41,

R36ZVUJYHZNNRA,B07YFXRNHF,5.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Good Unit,SCSingh,5,"Pretty good; Powerful & ClearThe experience starts with very neat, clean packaging; a theme that follows through to the device itself. It's a cylinder roughly a little shorter than an average adult male's hand, and is about half as wide. It's wrapped in matte black fabric, with a rubberized pad on the bottom - which both insulates against vibration and acts as a good, solid, slip-resistant base - with 4 large buttons arrayed on the top. All functionality can be easily achieved through these 4 buttons. There is a small port toward the bottom with a water-resistant cover, which houses both the charging and the Micro-SD slots. Around the buttons is a brushed metallic circle, imprinted with the device's brand (Monster) and model, and a short slogan. Connection is easy, and is automatic with the last paired device.The sound is generally impressive - It's pretty rich and clear, with one getting the impression that Monster really went for, and succeeded in achieving, high volume with this device. It is unexpectedly loud, and audio is satisfactorily clear even at higher volumes. The trade-off, however, is bass; specifically, there's not a whole lot, and this is a common weakness with smaller speakers (note that generally speaking, bass speakers do tend to be large). The speaker is up for the challenge of producing drums and low-range vocals, but performance falls away with lower frequency sounds. The little drivers do move and vibrate a lot, but perhaps they simply don't move enough air to adequately develop enough volume at low frequencies (human aren't naturally designed to be particularly sensitive to low-frequency sound, and as such, bass generally has to be pretty loud relative to the other frequencies for us to hear it properly).All in all, this is a good speaker, and has earned a 5th star despite not finding a way to better play lower frequency sounds; it is after all not a large speaker. I would recommend this speaker at this price point, provided that deep bass is not a priority for you, in which case, you may have to spend some more.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2020",AHZRBBJHTHSBORS6ASHHTWUYLP7A,True,6,

But overall I'm pretty satisfied and I am crazy picky about sound, I've been in the high-end audio since I was a kid and this is definitely not high-end audio, I love the fact that in the description that says this is just like being right in front of the live artists on the stage but it's not even close, that statement right there almost makes me want to get it one star LOL, it's a shame companies print descriptions like that to make a sale butif you're just looking for a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker that won't break the bank, something that's kind of a medium size so it's still nice and portable but not teeny tiny for casual listening I would assume you'll probably be happy with it.I like it, it's not perfect and it doesn't sound as good as they claim it does butts I've heard things that sound way worse than this,. Now if I listen to this for a while and then I turn on my home stereo this speaker makes me appreciate what my home stereo sounds like,. But this is probably one of the better sounding little Bluetooth speakers that I've heard for casual music listening, It is very impressive for what it is.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2020",AEP4IN5USFO5ERJSPNNHIPMNB5TA,True,5,

R3TMOV8DYANHF6,B07YFXRNHF,3.0 out of 5 stars Great 'upgrade' from my Bose Soundlink 2,Thomas Chastain,3,"I purchased my Bose Soundlink 2 about a year ago and was thoroughly disappointed. I really wanted to Mini, but Amazon had the Soundlink 2 for $80, so I gave it a shot. I liked the Bose initially, but found the mids and lows to be lacking.So, I saw Amazon was buying them back at $40 with trade in. I thought why not and looked at every speaker on Black Friday deal. I used to install car stereos in High School, and always used the Monster branded cables. So, I decided to give this speaker a shot, especially since I wanted the cylinder design.Overall, I am very pleased with the speaker. It hits the mids and treble extremely well. Bass isn't bad, but is a little lackluster (however for a 16W little speaker, it suffices). I like the battery life, size and design is great. Being able to skip a song from the speaker is a huge plus (Bose didn't offer this). The big drawback is the speaker takes about 30s to power on and pair to your phone (not a huge deal, but my past 3 BT Speakers have been virtually instantaneous). Other than that I highly recommended the speaker, just need to ensure I can pair 2 phones to it simultaneously, since my wife will use it when I 'm out of town (and not have to pair phones back and forth each time). Overall, for the price I rate this a 3.5 out of 5.EDIT 12/14/20: I ended up returning this speaker. Every time I would turn it on, it would blare full volume. So, I returned for a Tribit Stormbox. Not going to lie, the Tribit blows this speaker out of the water. Maybe I am too picky or this speaker doesn't fit my needs, but might work well for you.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020",AH7Y3ZF62XEBORSWU3J7X7IKSXNQ,True,7,
R2BT2G3C0CDG6H,B07YFXRNHF,5.0 out of 5 stars I'm a sucker for vertical speakers,Will,5,"I ordered this solely because it reminded me of my JBL Link 20 speakers. I wanted a vertical speaker for my office at work as previously I had a large Bluetooth speaker that looked like a guitar amplifier that took up too much real estate on my desktop. The vertical form factor would work well for my use case as it would still give me some decent sized speakers but not take up as much desk surface. Once I received it I was shocked how close this and my JBL were in construction and appeance except for size. This Monster brand speaker is like the younger smaller brother. The speaker is covered in an attractive mesh all around the vertical portion and control buttons are on the top, just like my JBL. It can be charged with a connection port on the back that is covered by a thick rubber door when not in use. The speaker sounds excellent for the price. It's not quite up there with some others I have but cost a fraction of the price I do appreciate that, to my ears anyway, it sounds like a flatter sound profile vs some other brands available. The trend now seems to be to overly emphasize bass and it can make some music sound very muddled. The controls are easy to use with large buttons on the top of the speaker and I haven't had any issues with streaming songs or taking calls. I haven't heard any complaints on phone call quality and to be blunt I talk to a lot of complainers throughout the day. For the price this is hard to beat.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2020",AGISGBNB66BPIQYSDUKNXGVYNLCA,True,22,

This has decreased to where I get maybe a good 40 minutes now before the low battery warning & in the last month the speaker won't fully charge & the charging light has not come on. I've tried different charging cables & different wall outlets/charging points which work for all my other devices, so I know it's the speaker.

Pairs very easily, has a good feel and weight to it and the sound quality is pretty amazing. More bass than I would have expected and the mids and highs have extreme clarity. If you listen to music up close to this speaker you’ll hear sounds in songs that you didn’t know were there. Very good. The icing on the cake for this speaker is the battery life.

I charge it only once a week with moderate amount of listening, atleast 2-3 hours daily.

Big enough to get the job done but easily portable. The recharging is via a micro USB port on the back. I charged it for about an hour and have not had to charge it again for over a week.

I bought 2 hoping the combined 36 Watts and 4 drivers would do the job. They go sorta loud enough but the low end is very weak, even indoors placed in a corner. They have some decent headroom though and respond well to EQing but still... For a combined price of eighty USD you could get an anker motion boom with WAY bigger sound.On the good side, they feel pretty darn solid. The pairing to each other in stereo is painless and reliable. True stereo sound is kinda nice.All in all however, I am selling my pair and getting the Anker.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2021",AES2R7NAGG3QMNR4HH2XUIPU7JSQ,True,1,

Once we finally figured out how to get it to work. Wow! It sounded great. Like spatial audio if you center yourself between the two speakers. He immediately ordered two more Emberton II’s so we could both enjoy the stacking feature.The only disappointment is that it doesn’t stack in stereo. So you don’t get that speaker interplay from stereo recordings.To stack, only connect one of the two speakers via bluetooth to your device. Then follow the instructions for button pressing to stack the second one, without connecting it to the same device via bluetooth. The speakers connect to each other independently. While the main one is connected to your device.They are also surprisingly loud.The Marshall app EQ controls are kind of lame. But you can get a bit more base out of it.Very pleased!

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,168,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

It seamlessly blends timeless design with cutting-edge technology, delivering a speaker that not only looks stunning but also sounds exceptional. The iconic Marshall logo adorns the front, paying homage to the brand’s heritage.Portability and Convenience: The Emberton’s compact size, weighing just 0.7 kilograms, makes it incredibly portable. Slip it into your bag or pocket, and you have a powerful sound system wherever you go.Sound Performance: Don’t be fooled by its size; the Emberton packs a punch. With two 10W drivers, it delivers a surprisingly rich and dynamic sound. The bass is deep and satisfying, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp, offering a well-balanced audio experience. Even at high volumes, the sound remains distortion-free, showcasing Marshall’s commitment to audio excellence.In conclusion, the Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall’s engineering prowess. It defies its size, delivering a sound quality that rivals much larger speakers. Its robust build, impressive battery life, and excellent sound make it a top choice in the realm of portable Bluetooth speakers. Whether you’re a music enthusiast, a frequent traveller, or someone who values premium audio in a compact form, the Marshall Emberton is a stellar choice.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",AEB5JEKNO3NNDOMDWCOKF2H3WDJA,True,25,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton
R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,12,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term.

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters – B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker – and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed. I'm a convert and already planning to surround myself with more of these pocket-sized wonders!Cheers,","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AEWYYN4J3I3I5IIF5QNOBAF4GYIQ,True,5,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEKPQRCBV3DNLRZCMJSGQMSGSLAA,True,8,Color: Black
RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6S748H,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you’ve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it’s okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don’t try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you’re pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I’m missing the mark on its intended use, but I don’t think so. For small sound and high portability, it’s okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I’ll have to sample it for a while and along others. I’m on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I’ll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it’s pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it’s been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,True,16,Color: White

My past Speakers(Sonos Beam and Sonos One) often would just randomly not be recognized and setting them up again was a horrible pain. I purchased this Roam 2 because I had been using a Sonos One outside for the last couple of years and it died (I figured that it might eventually since it wasn't designed for outdoors even though it was covered).I'm thankfully that the new Roam 2 is waterproof and I like it's streamlined design and the sound it good. Setup was relatively easy although I really disliked that they just sent a cheap usb C connector instead of an actual plug. The connector sent was a usb c to usb c so I had to search for a spare ""brick"" and a spare usb c cable which I fortunately had but still...I thought that was a poor way to start.I never could get Alexa to work which was frustrating but I noticed that Sonos now has it's own voice assistant and that works well.I'm overall satisfied with the speaker and hoping it stays consistent and performs well.

I can see other speakers being better for the same price point, but here's a breakdown of what I have found after using it consistently for the past week or so:Connectivity - In the sense of range to connect, it is quite low. I have had multiple instances where I was using the speaker with bluetooth and it would start cutting out when I was 10+ feet away. On the other hand, you can also connect to this speaker through wifi which gives it great connectivity range.Ease of use - It is a pretty simple device with only 6 buttons (Play/Pause, volume up, volume down, voice activation, bluetooth, and power). No complaints here though I cannot speak for the voice feature as I have not used it yet.Sound quality - The sound quality is great for its size. If you are an audiophile, you have probably heard better speakers but for this size it is definitely above the standard.Battery Life - The battery life it pretty spotty and has been hard for me to understand. Sonos says it has 10 hour battery life off of full charge but I would probably say it is closer to 8.5-9 hrs from my use of it.Additional notes - The app is pretty annoying to use and can only be used when your device is connected to wifi. On the app you can control your music/audio you are playing and also balance the speakers treble and bass (something I have not been able to do off of wifi)","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AE775KVYVVC2ISN27P7OZDSY2SBQ,True,0,Color: Black

After I uninstalled the Amazon Shopping app, the Sonos app was finally able to sign in w/Amazon and complete the Alexa integration setup.5 stars for sound quality, 1 star for the setup process.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEWS6FRXILGAV2NJZF2YWJ5EXWMQ,True,7,Color: Black

It has great tonality and an expansive sound stage, one which is tailored to your listening area. I have tried a lot of mobile blue tooth speakers, and this is one of the best in terms of audio quality, which is, absolutely, one of the most impot5rant factors, really the most important. I would compare it only to the Klipsch, B & O, Devialet.So why did I rate it 4 stars?1. I find it insulting or worse when a piece of equipment in this price range is so intrusive, puts so much effort into violating your privacy. Install the app and you will have none. I fully intend to uninstall rhe app. I may even do a full reset on my phone, but having installed it and created an accoujnt I asm already on a list they wil undoubtedly be selling.You can set up blue tooth without the app, but not wifi. Having connected to blue tooth I had to reset the speaker to install the app. It took me hou4rs, much like the B & O, which I was unhappy with for exactly the same reasons.*IF* you use th3 app you can not use a music player. I personally hate listening to music on my phone. In fact, I needed to make a call but couldn't because I was using the speaker, and it completely drained the battery on my phone. (Wifi and blue tooth will do that) make a call and could not because I was using the speaker. It also completely drained my phone's battery.2. Using a player would not have given me the benefits I get on many other blue tooth speakers because the Roam does not process lossless blue tooth codecs. You lose detail in transmission. Not everyone cares about this but most audiophile listeners do, so for a company of this quality, producing equipment in this price range, it is surprising and disappointing.No aptx, aptx hd or ldac.It does do some tricks if you have other Sonos speakers, like casting to the speaker in the next room.3. IPX rating questionable. The port is open, uncovered. I would not take this speaker to the beach, or even out ion the rain.With or without the app? The app does get you spatial tuning, BUT, besides issues already mentioned I lost the DAC on my FIIO, in addition to lossless blue tooth.In sum, the sound is very good but I feel that you pay a high price for it in terms of intrusiveness.I do not feel as though I would be sacrificing a great deal if I listened to my Klipsch instead, on my FIIO, weith location... turned off on my phone. We all have our priorities.

The Alexa integration is also very good - you can power up the speaker and ask Alexa to play anything through connected services like Spotify or other music libraries and it does what you expect it to do - play music! The real let down is in in the recent overhaul of the Sonos app. Unfortunately, Sonos took a very good functioning S2 app and ruined it when they relaunched the app to handle the new Sonos Ace headphones. They've been working on re-adding features for the last two months and it's starting to improve, but very slowly. So buyer beware - you may want to wait until they get the app back to a more solid state before you jump into a Roam.

The first thing people say is that it is amazing for it's size. I agree and appreciate it for the amazing sound and portability. This is easy competition for Beats pill or the Bose versions in this size group and better in many ways. One of the ways is the tech. Also known as the bad reviews, at least for now. They need to update some areas with the software and the app. This needs to work perfect for what it cost (I hope you hear me Sonos!). If they fix the connectivity and wifi issues this is a winner. If you want a great piece of hardware with stand alone function it's a winner. For owners of other Sonos products having issues, they owe you an apology and a quick solution.

I have bought one or two of these in the past as well as I have some friends with some small bluetooth speakers like this and I have to say this definitely punches above its weight class. I would expect nothing less from SONOS but I was still surprised. It is also a lot more simple to use than most others, the bluetooth pairing button on the back makes pairing to a new device sooooo much easier. You don’t need to guess at what combo of buttons you need to hold to put it into pairing mode. One other thing I like that others may not like is that if you do not play any sound for a few minutes it will auto shut off. I personally like this because it saves battery at times where I know I would have forgotten to turn it off myself. USB C charging is a nice touch also now that most things are using this charger is almost the only cable I have now. I have not tested the mic yet but I have jumped into the pool with it once so I can say its waterproof at least for the 4 foot pool I jumped into.

Pairing over Bluetooth is simple, as with like any other Bluetooth speaker or other device. Pairing is the same. But like the other Sonos speakers this is also made specifically to work with the Sonos App in which you can connect multiple speakers throughout a home. That works well but I struggle to see why that'd be important on a portable speaker. I suppose it is nice to have the option. The sound is very good. It can get loud enough for a whole room. The trembles and mids are nice and clear. The bass is loud too (but I did notice some mudding at higher volume which is honestly to be expected with a portable speaker like this.) I took off the one star for this.Overall I think this is a very good speaker and people who want the Sonos app connectivity will love this. But I took off the one star because the sound is about the same as some other premium Bluetooth speakers that cost significantly less.

I was impressed with the low end of this speaker for its compact small size, but other than that, I can’t say that I would recommend on sound quality. The high end is completely missing and adjusting via the setting does virtually nothing. I want to qualify that with the fact I understand I’m not getting a live performance out of this thing but there really is no high end. I did t have any issues connecting to the product via Bluetooth as other have stated but if that is the case a software update should fix those. I had and issue at first hooking Apple Music into it but a reboot of my phone and the speaker fixed that. Its small size makes it versatile and it surely feels like a quality product. Battery life is good while overall performance is meh middle of the road. I have heard great things about Sonos products but I’m not sold yet.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AFA34467RZQ7UBJVQG2TQ3JJDYFQ,False,0,Color: Black

There's no question about that. But you do get what you pay for and this is a portable camping type speaker. The only thing I would advise is they do make rubber protective boots for t well they're not exactly designed for this model is the previous model a little bit of work with an X-Acto knife and you can cut out the necessary cut out so that you can hit the button in the back, but that makes a difference as far as impact resistance so worth picking one of those up.

In this case, I used Home Assistant to connect to the Sonos Roam 2 and send audio. In my case, I have the speaker plugged into trickle charge as I mostly have power where it’s at, but the battery as a little battery back up so I can continue to control it even when there is no power at that location. Battery life is about as you would expect for something of that size. Nothing too stellar but nothing that’s gonna drop off ridiculously quick either.Sound quality wise, this lives up to the Sonos name. Sound was rich and full with no issues at any of the extremes. Adjustability and control are exactly as Sonos advertises and they work great. While there is a microphone included, I did not test that feature, though I would imagine, it should work.It also has Bluetooth and that seems to work well. It pairs nicely and you can send audio to it just fine. Range is about as expected with no problems that I experienced.About the only thing that should be noted is it really wants a high-speed USB-C charger. And my case I trickle charge it over an old-school USB charger and it warns me, but it sits plugged in most of the time so it’s OK. If you want to charge it faster though you’re going to need to use a proper USB-C charger.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHNR76YHIEJ2R73EOK6VHX22YYVA,False,0,Color: Black

Setup was pretty straightforward, but I did need to reboot it a couple times to get it to properly play in sync with the other speakers. I think that may have just been a one-time thing, since it's worked perfectly every other time I've sent music to it.In terms of sound, it's pretty good. It doesn't have a super rich bass, compared to my other Sonos speakers, but it's still decent. I use the overture from Tron: Legacy as a test track, so I have a reference I can compare on each speaker I listen on, and it does miss some of the really rich deep notes when the music swells at around 1:35.All that said, this isn't a one-speaker-replacement for an amazing sound system. It's a portable speaker that sounds pretty great, which is suitable for taking outdoors and can sync with your existing Sonos system, and it excels at that. I mostly use it as a small portable speaker playing jazz on my back patio during family get-togethers or dinner, and to supplement my existing Sonos system, and it is perfect for that.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AH2DY3SGYMCGUSFYXZLQO2S7XLBQ,False,2,Color: Black

Wifi and smart features allows it to be used in the shower without your iphone too!SONOS Integration: The integration is the best thing ever. I can listen to music anywhere around the house through wifi. And when I get back into the house I can go and hold the play button and it’ll transfer what I’m listening to on the bigger sound system (i.e. SONOS arc, more to be added soon.)SOUND QUALITY: It’s the best speaker at this size. I’ve had comparable speakers and I’ve only been impressed with Bose. This gives bose a run for it’s money, integration, and pure beauty. It’s bass is full and the high mids and lows are all there.

This speaker sounds good, not quite as nice as the Sonos 1 but when they are paired together I can't really tell the difference. I'm not an aficionado by any means but when I had these two playing together, it made me go ""Oh, I should get another Sonos 1, that'd sound real nice"". Initial set up with Bluetooth was simple, but getting it to pair with my Sonos 1 took a couple minutes, a WTF, and a phone restart to get everything synced up. I wish charging status light would stay on while charging, mine doesn't even with the status light enabled in app. Also wish battery % wasn't buried so far down the app, it should be right there on the main screen in the app. Is this the best speaker at this size and price, I don't know but probably not.. I know you can get a good bluetooth speaker for less than this. Does that speaker play well with another Sonos speaker? No. If you're invested in the Sono ecosystem, I think you would like this.

However, since launch we have found a number of issues. Fixing these issues has delayed our prior plan to quickly incorporate missing features and functionality.Since May 7, we have released new software updates approximately every two weeks, each making significant and meaningful improvements, adding features and fixing bugs. Please see the release notes for Sonos software updates for detailed information on what has been released to date.While these software updates have enabled the majority of our customers to have a robust experience using the Sonos app, there is more work to be done. We have prioritized the following improvements in our next phase of software updates:July and August:- Improving the stability when adding new products- Implementing Music Library configuration, browse, search, and playAugust and September:- Improving Volume responsiveness- User interface improvements based on customer feedback- Improving overall system stability and error handlingSeptember:- Improving Alarm consistency and reliabilitySeptember and October:- Restoring edit mode for Playlists and the Queue- Improving functionality in settings- We plan to continue releasing new software updates on a bi-weekly cadence. With each release, we will share detailed notes on what we’ve addressed and what we’re working on next in our Community.We deeply appreciate your patience as we address these issues.

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price.

R1WXFJO25KJ87Y,B0B43Y8GHZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Worse sound than expected,Strikeout321,2,"We have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc…and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it’s older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there’s virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of “tinny” during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn’t sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that’s half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that’s about the most I would ever pay for it…but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you’ll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it’s stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn’t specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product. The grip is too flimsy for the weight of the speaker.

The unit plays nice and loud, will be great for the beach! I guess I didn’t pay attention to the specs as the unit is much larger than I anticipated when I ordered. The integrated carry handle makes it easy to carry, but it’s still rather large.Keeping the Sony despite the size because the sound is crazy good. Looks like you can also use several in parallel (not sure if all have to be Sony?). The light feature can be turned on and off and, there is an input plug so you could use this speaker as a guitar amp! Now, that’s definitely great for the beach!!I don’t know if there is a carry case, haven’t looked yet, but the unit is described as water and dust resistant/proof.I’ve only just received the speaker but I don’t see any obvious flaws or blemishes that might be of immediate concern - we’ll see how this unit holds up after a coupe trips on the boat and to the beach - the real test!!!","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2022",AETS5JPRCP7L2F37BVYBYOMHBIYQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

Gorgeous looking speaker. Time will tell how the fabric holds up, but manual says it can be washed with water. I bought a case for it also. Note that this is BIG, and that it is not the kind of speaker that can get tossed in a backpack. More of a party speaker. I think that Sonys are really the best speakers out there, and this does not disappoint. There also is a battery health saving mode that does not let it fully charge.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse.

The LEDs were only on the sides.After returning Sony, I found this speaker, and couldn't be more happy: sound clarity, bass, looks, weight, LED in front and sides, and half the price of Sony.Highly recommended.Update: took it to the pool, to the beach, got a lot of compliments on the kick it packs. People couldn't believe it's only 100 bucks for the quality of sound and bass it delivers.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGFUPHHSCPFXMKKPXW4W67NPWOJQ,True,3,
R1FF16POT3SUDN,B09SNYHYV7,4.0 out of 5 stars Overpriced for only 60 watts,LiteningKid,4,"I didn’t check the wattage, it was in my price range for size and Bluetooth connectivity. Sounds great but it should’ve been at least 80 watts for that price. I didn’t return it because it is just loud and clear enough for the back yard. Great for indoor music pleasure. If you don’t want to have your neighbors calling the cops but good audio at a decent price, this will work for you. Battery life is not the best but decent, it’ll last an entire bbq, depending on how loud you run it, without the lights. But, you are not getting equivalent to what you paid.

R3FCYHQ0K72ANB,B09SNYHYV7,5.0 out of 5 stars Tronsmart Bang is better than Sony XG300,Paul T. Onomura,5,"Tronsmart Bang is comparable with the Sony SRS-XG300. They are similar in size. Yet the Tronsmart Bang is roughly $100 cheaper, especially with the discount on Amazon, it's louder, had more bass, & sounds clearer. Battery doesn't last as long as the Sony. You get more Bang for your money with the Tronsmart Bang. The Bang is a great sounding speaker that gets pretty loud for it's size. It's splash resistant like the Sony, has a great design, uses quality materials to produce, to top it off, under $100 on Amazon makes it a great deal. Tronsmart Bang is easily recommended.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFLNMODSR2GI6QAXQXBZUM5XQ2DA,True,2,

RQQKEHKO3A09F,B09SNYHYV7,3.0 out of 5 stars Not worth $100+,Jacob Wallace,3,Bass is definitely lacking for the size and weight of this thing. General audio sounds scooped. Without playing specific frequencies through this speaker I can't pinpoint where it's missing but the audio is definitely missing a certain frequency range. I have a JBL charge 5 and this thing is twice the size but can't come close to recreating the same sound.* I bought this to play live guitar through fl studio... It has way too much latency to play live audio though it. ASIO driver is saying 6ms but I'm getting around 175 to 200 ms lag via aux. Even after reset and forgetting Bluetooth connection it still has the same latency. Bt latency via Android latency test app shows 200ms.I bought this on prime day so the price I paid it might be worth it for general outdoors functions but not at full price...,"Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AEBVS6FDBWWMBQOCWCSDQQI5YLOA,True,0,

It does have some distortion when played on certain songs but if you adjust the eq settings it sounds great. I did all the norms I do with all the speakers or radios I buy. Cooked it for two,days then blasted it on the fourth and it worked great. After a week it gave out. OtHer than that I still want an exchange because it sounded that good. Reminds me of a 80s boombox sound but better. I hope the guys at transport come up with a bigger one for the summer or holidays. Careful with the distortion though. I believe you can give JBL.

However, due to the persistent issue of it not fully charging and the incessant blinking, I feel compelled to share my thoughts early. In hindsight, I should have heeded the warnings from other reviews.The most disappointing aspect of this speaker is its abysmal battery life. I can't stress this enough – it's absolutely terrible, terrible, terrible. While it's undeniably loud, it severely lacks in the bass department. We all have that one specific song we use to test a speaker's bass capabilities, but with this one, the results are underwhelming. Even when you attempt to play music at high volumes, it becomes distorted. Frankly, I'm not sure what's going on with this speaker, but I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it.

RLGGILF2KV5HQ,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars This Little Speaker is Seriously Impressive,Julian,5,"Pros:- Sound quality is the best in it's class. This speaker has lots of depth and is rich, immersive and crystal clear. I find that when I listen to this speaker about a foot or two away on my desk, it sounds so, so rich - especially with low-fi songs. The 360-sound effect creates a very immersive stereo effect. You learn to appreciate and notice it with more usage. Overall, I enjoy how this speaker sounds with most genres - especially genres with clear instrumentals and vocals. This is clearly not a giant bass monster due to its size, but the depth and richness in the bass is surprising, especially when set up about a foot away from a wall. Overall, I would give the sound quality a 10/10 compared to the many other speakers I have tested in the past (Sony, JBL, etc..). This may not be the loudest speaker for the price, but it is definitely the most hi-fi when compared to the other mono-sounding options. Personally, I find that it gets VERY loud for casual listening. Nonetheless, the sound that comes out of this little speaker is trippy. it gives off the impression (mainly when it's close to you) that you're listening to a large, rich speaker. It's also worth mentioning that the quality is retained even in lower volumes.- Design. Easily the most beautiful bluetooth speaker I've had. Made from nothing but premium materials and it looks beautiful. Not much else to say here. It's also really tiny which makes it more adorable and portable. Perfect for picnics.- Battery life. As I mentioned earlier, this thing gets plenty loud. I usually play music at around 30% on this speaker and find that it is plenty loud for casual listening. Most people may opt for 50% while around the house. Regardless, the battery life is insanely good. This efficiency in battery life has to do with the type of amplifier this speaker is.Cons:- Hmm... I can't really think of any. I feel that it is priced fairly. While you can buy slightly bigger, more powerful speakers, they will simply lack the depth and richness in sound coming from this little thing. This is more of a high-quality listening experience compared to the ""boominess"" of larger speakers that feel like the sound is being muddled through some sort of barrier. Point is, anything below the retail price is a steal for this awesome speaker.Overall, this is such an awesome and special little speaker. It's hard to compare because it's very distinct in it's own unique way when you factor in the crazy 360 audio + amazing clarity and richness in bass. They really nailed this one.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021",AHCJJ56LCEOOVCREE23TC6BY3FCQ,True,49,
R2XUYU4VTT9WR7,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Marshall vs. Bose Soundlink Flex vs. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore : This Wins hands down.,Kindle Customer,5,"Purchased all the three of the above portable bluetooth speakers as the JBL flip I have had for years had only one volume (Loud) and sounded more and more as it was coming through a tin can. When I lived alone I could crank music on my stereo through high end gear in most of the house, but now I have to be more considerate of my roommate. I suspected none of the offerings in the class of speaker were going to be great, but wanted something that at least didn't make my fingernails itch. As I get tired of wearing ear buds/head phones, decided this was the perfect opportunity to try an upgrade. Thanks to all the purchasers who did reviews, it helps to limit the field and I do rely heavily on customer feedback in making a buying decision.So in last place without even listening to anything else was the Bose Soundlink Flex. It only sounded marginally better than the old one I have which is terrible. If that was as good as it gets I would have just stuck with constantly wearing earbuds.In the middle was the Ban & Olufsen Beosound Expore. The sound was much fuller and less muddy. While it wasn't great it was tolerable. A bonus was that you got sound all around so would be perfect when you are working and moving in the room. While significantly heavier and bulkier than the Bose, it was in the middle size wise as the Marshall was without question the largest of the three. The app was nice as well although I don't like using those to control my speakers particularly when working because my hands are usually busy and messy and don't want to be handling the phone constantly. It had a small strap for carrying but it was definitely going to need to be clipped on to something very securely if you are moving around with it.The Marshall won by a mile. The sound was far more full, less muddy and with sound coming out both forwards and rear continued to give an all around sound as opposed to one direction of sound. Perhaps size is a function of sound quality because without question it is the largest. it is also the best looking. As I plan to use this around my house, it is perfectly fine in size and if the sound hadn't been tolerable I was going to go evetn bigger with a plugged in blue tooth speaker even though that would have been a pain in the butt.Am I getting the quality of sound I would prefer? No of course not and I wasn't expecting to as size is a clear element in recreation of sound. I don't know if this will be as sturdy as the other two. Both of them seemed encased in .more shock absorbing materials.This was also the most expensive but not significantly more. Given the vast improvement in sound quality I was more than willing to pay a bit more and the Prime Day sale price definitely helped.I will update with use. I would have posted a video but based on my own listening to reviews, I realize that they are truly not helpful because what you are listening on will be big part of the sound you are hearing.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AHJLVEDB5WVDCHC4U5BHOVCBKKCQ,True,23,

My audio experience and extensive audio knowledge in speaker system and crossover network design spans almost 5 decades. The Marshall Stockwell II most certainly takes advantage of soft and hard surface geometry for tailoring to individual psychoacoustic tastes and preferences. The bass and treble controls offer outstanding range of boost and cut in broad frequency spectrums. This is absolutely the BEST portable for its size on the market. Clear, clean audio at all reproduction levels and can be pushed into slight fuzz at extremes.

R31MXTZXOVQYOG,B088KRKFJ3,4.0 out of 5 stars Loud enough,Rachel in Washington,4,"Great unit. Was a bit worried that it wasn't loud enough when I first got it, then I remembered that you can control the volume not only with the knobs on this unit but also with your phone; once I jacked up the volume control on my phone, it was louder than I'll probably ever need it to be. The sound is noticeably richer/fuller than a cheaper, smaller portable Marshall speaker I tried, so it was an easy decision to keep this one and return the other. The other reason I prefer this unit is this one has treble and bass controls. I'm not sure how I feel about the strap, so I'm glad it can be tucked behind the unit out of sight, and I'm glad it's detachable. It looks like an adorable little baby amp without the strap. The unit was very easy to pair with my phone and didn't require installing a new app. It came with a charging cord but not the chunky little cube that the cord plugs into to plug into an electrical outlet, which was a little disappointing, but I had another one that I use for another purpose that I was able to use, so I guess we're saving the environment by not having a dedicated chunky cube for this unit, which admittedly I don't anticipate needing to charge very often. All in all I'm very happy with this speaker; I'm deducting one star only because it would be nice if it could go louder, given the price. It's just barely loud enough but it would be nice if it could knock my socks off and be something I could be confident would be loud enough for a house party.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2023",AFXIGBFBX6UHWTAE5YEEWIMAZWNA,True,8,

R2WLO94PODNLIO,B088KRKFJ3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Front & Back ""360"" driver design is King 👑",M. Baker,5,"I tend to scour the internet for hours of reviews and YouTube videos and any information I can when it comes to audio/video/PC part purchases.It was between this, the older Denon Envaya and Anker Soundcore Motion+.(price point between 100 - 200.) I snagged the Stockwell II on WHD for 140 and it is undoubtedly the best BT speaker in my small collection.Moving up from mainly a Divoom Outdoor2 it's such a difference. The sound is FULL and the onboard EQ edjustments are a real luxury. Bass is balanced, not boomy! Not muddy! Very clean.For those who don't know the Outdoor2 and Stockwell II both have drivers on both the front and back of the speakers. The soundstage and stereo separation effects this does has now become a must-have for me. I don't think I can't use a BT speaker that doesn't produce ""360"" sound in this way.The Stockwell 2 is the best off-axis, walk around the house, portable speaker I can think of. It sounds great from so many angles instead of just front and center. I love this thing. The black and brass version is super sleek.Main cons: It's not super duper loud. If you're taking this outside with other noises you'd be better off with a larger boombox style speaker. This probably won't cut it for you. Volume settings 1-5 *are* pretty low vs. other boomier, muddier, mono sounding BT speakers.6-8 are mostly where I stay9-10 imo are plenty loud and would definitely disturb my upstairs neighbor.In conclusion, the Stockwell 2 is all about sound quality. And it provides that whether you're at 10% or 100% volume - across all genres. Extreme metal, synthwave, R&B, you name it, it's got you covered. Drop any bias towards the Marshall brand name - this speaker lives up to any hype and is worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021",AH2BBTHCLJ7EGLZTWSSZ3QPUJCHQ,True,14,

R32K5TTVL773ND,B088KRKFJ3,1.0 out of 5 stars Bad - previous Marshall Customer (long review),Caffeine & Curate,1,"This is gonna be a long detailed review for those of you that really like a lot of detail!1. I am a previous customer of a Marshall, portable speaker - Kilburn 1 - I’ve had this for a few years and I have yet to ever have a problem with Bluetooth pairing. I only use it when I want to feel surroundsound on my flatscreen TV or I want to plug it to my Crosley record player - so other than that it just sits and waits for me to use it and it is still working till this day!That one cost me a pretty penny as well I think into the $299 range but the reason I was looking for some thing smaller with the handle was the Kilburn original is super heavy.I wanted a smaller Marshall speaker because they look beautiful, I wanted a handle for the portability of moving it between my bathroom my kitchen in my office space when I’m listening to music and podcasts.2. Let’s talk about the review of the actual product. Spoiler Alert: there isn’t much to say because I could not pair it. I even let it re-charge overnight just in case even though it said it was fully charged at arrival.I tried pairing it with two different iPhones. I don’t need to try anymore than this.! I have owned multiple JBL, portable speakers, and other cheaper brands and pairing has never been a problem!So for any product to take this long to try to pair means that Marshall really made a horrible product or a really big, horrible batch considering the other negative reviews on the Bluetooth pairing, and the item going out after six months or even a year!* the other thing I noticed the very last time I tried to pair it was the moment I turned the volume knob to turn on the device. I heard a split second of a static sound, and I knew that wasn’t good.!This item arrived as a refurbished item so I had gotten it for $145. I was super excited because I buy a lot of Amazon refurbished products including very expensive Apple products, and I can’t tell you how wonderful of an experience I’ve had buying refurbished or used or open box where some products would arrive mostly completely blemish free! And they would last a long time!So I will be returning this and considering this defective when I return it. If it doesn’t work out of the box, it’s not going to work and it’s not a good product and that’s my very strong opinion when it comes to any electronics that you purchase.Marshall, if you’re reading this, considering your other reviews, you made a really bad product you need to reconsider your manufacturer and may be any possible shortcutsI really specifically wanted this for the size of how small it was and the awesome handle that came with it so if you can remake this product, I would still buy and try it in the future! This honestly would’ve been the most perfect size for my little one bedroom apartment and I’m really sad to say I don’t think I want to try paying more for a brand new one considering the reviews that it may end up going out in six months or a year.I have JBL portable speakers that are still going strong and they at least go strong for 2 1/2 years and they cost a third of the price!","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2023",AGYZFA3V2LHRBMGVCO4KFGFRV33A,True,2,

Decent for casual listening, but not for those who are like “Bass or bust!” Using EQ on apps helps more then just turning up the bass dial.Overall sound for this size speaker: 8/10 Despite the weakness in bass, this speaker sounds superb and high end, and you will hear all the lovely details of your music. It also has amazing surround effects and is basically a 360 degree speaker.Battery: haven’t tested it but it seems decent and charges fairly fast.Connectivity: Bluetooth has no problems and works perfectly.Who this is for: people who want a nice, classy small speaker that sounds good from all angles.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2022",AGQJXKQPKR7QAY4RBFZM7W6NDWJQ,True,17,

I bought this because it was relatively low in volume and I didn't need much of a space to fill with sound. However, the bass is atrocious. Bass is meant to be felt not heard and all i hear is someone trying to punch my ear drums with every song. I do have tinitus so i can be sensitive to bass however the Stockwell 2 just slams it at you even with low volume and bass dial all the way down. Build quality and look is fantastic, i wish it worked out because of that. But I have heard other Marshall speakers in stores and they were all Bass over clarity. Hopefully they can come out with something with a more neutral sound, clarity, and no horrible ""punchy bass"".

By FAR the best I’ve ever heard from a portable Bluetooth speaker. And the little bass and treble nobs on top are very useful. The build of the speaker is very sturdy and rugged (and water resistance). I had the speaker for less than an hour before I got online to buy another one. But I finally decided to wait a couple of months and see if it passes the test of time.

Upon receiving it, I charged it overnight and used it in my office for over a week on the same charge. But then I couldn’t find the charger and did not use it for about two months. In November, I found the original box in my office closet and the charger was inside (yay!) so I connected it — but it did not charge up. Over the next couple weeks, I tried again with two different charging blocks but it still didn’t charge, even over night. Today I contacted Amazon to ask if customer support could help me fix or replace it. They talked me through some troubleshooting (cleaning the charge port, resetting it, etc.) but nothing has helped. Now Amazon wants to charge a restocking fee to send it back, which seems unfair. I want to fix or replaceme it and it should still be under warranty since it’s less than 5 months old and worked perfectly when it first arrived. There’s no reason it shouldn’t last longer than that. It hasn’t been abused in any way — it just sat in my desk without power for a couple months. Is that something that could cause damage?

R2DRA7FKP4LV9F,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars The best bluetooth speaker I've ever had,Jenna,5,"I bought this on sale for Prime Day two and a half years ago and it has been truly amazing. Being able to adjust the treble/bass is awesome for listening to different types of music. The sound feels so true and rich. It is portable and the little handle is awesome, but be aware it is very dense. It's not light but it is small and to me, that is not a downside but this isn't the sort of speaker you'd want to hang from a backpack and walk around with all day.The battery life is insane. I will actually go months between charging it with regular use. There was some review I read before buying this that said the volume control style (not a 1 to 1 increase in sound for how you turn the knob, it's exponential instead so the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the turning doesn't do much but any tweaking in the last 1/3 of the dial does a TON to change the volume) takes a lot less power than ""regular"" volume control and that's part of what makes the battery life so great. If I had to guess, I would say I've charged this speaker less than 10 times over two and a half years.I don't think I'll ever get a different brand of bluetooth speaker than Marshall after how amazing this has been. But it seems this little speaker is holding up so well, I won't have to shop for quite a long time.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2022",AGVCTW3LKB5Z5PU3UQVS2ATJ67GQ,False,0,

R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GK5JMHK,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I’ve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I’ve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn’t believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I’ve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you’re entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you’re able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can’t help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GK5JMHK,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you’ll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6
RILMKXRAW75NM,B09GK5JMHK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds excellent outdoors,Austin Yde,5,"This speaker has definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of audio quality. It does a have a few imperfections, but overall I think it deserves 5 stars. The mids and highs get drowned out a bit by the bass when indoors. However, I’ve found that when outside, the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on. It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy. Highly recommend for audiophiles looking for an outdoor speaker that you want to bring with you anywhere.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AF3PVTN5RKAL3R2VZTNN6W5N3BIQ,True,0,Color: GreyStyle: Flip 6
